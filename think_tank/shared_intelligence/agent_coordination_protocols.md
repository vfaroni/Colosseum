# üèõÔ∏è COLOSSEUM Shared Intelligence - Agent Coordination Protocols

**Updated**: Daily by all agents  
**Access**: Bill + Vitor agents (read/write)

---

## üéØ **DUAL-USER COORDINATION FRAMEWORK**

### **Cross-User Visibility Rules**
- **Bill's agents** can READ Vitor's missions/reports (reference only)
- **Vitor's agents** can READ Bill's missions/reports (reference only)  
- **No cross-user editing** of missions/reports (maintain accountability)
- **Shared mission board** visible to both users for coordination

### **Collaboration Triggers**
**Automatic coordination required for**:
- Large dataset updates affecting both users
- System architecture changes
- API key rotations or access issues
- Federal regulation changes requiring compliance updates

## ü§ñ **AGENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS**

### **Mission Assignment Hierarchy**
```
STRIKE LEADER (Bill/Vitor) 
    ‚Üì Issues missions to
WINGMAN (Technical execution)
TOWER (Strategic oversight) 
SECRETARY (Administrative tasks)
    ‚Üì Report completion to  
STRIKE LEADER (Coordination)
```

### **Cross-Agent Mission Authority**
- **STRIKE LEADER ‚Üí Any Agent**: Full mission assignment authority
- **TOWER ‚Üí Any Agent**: Strategic oversight and risk assessment missions
- **WINGMAN ‚Üí TOWER**: Technical challenge escalation
- **SECRETARY ‚Üí STRIKE LEADER**: Administrative escalation and deal coordination

### **Emergency Escalation Protocol**
1. **System failures** ‚Üí Immediate TOWER notification
2. **Data integrity issues** ‚Üí STRIKE LEADER + TOWER coordination
3. **API outages** ‚Üí WINGMAN technical response + SECRETARY business continuity
4. **Client deadlines** ‚Üí All agents collaboration mode

## üìã **MISSION MANAGEMENT STANDARDS**

### **Mission Creation Requirements**
- **Unique Mission ID**: `USER-AGENT-PROJECT-###` (e.g., BILL-WINGMAN-TEXAS-001)
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and deliverables
- **Timeline Specification**: Start date, milestones, completion target
- **Resource Requirements**: Datasets, APIs, coordination needs
- **Cross-references**: Related missions from other agents/users

### **Mission Status Tracking**
- **PENDING**: Mission created, not yet started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Active work underway
- **BLOCKED**: Waiting for dependencies or external factors

### **Mandatory Reporting Requirements**
- **ALL agents** must file completion reports before finishing todo lists
- **Draft reports** required for incomplete sessions (crash protection)
- **Cross-references** to related work by other agents/users
- **Performance metrics** included in all technical reports

### **Report Types**
- **Completion Report**: Final deliverable with results and recommendations
- **Progress Report**: Interim status for long-running missions
- **Handoff Report**: Transfer of work between agents
- **Issue Report**: Problems requiring escalation or coordination

### **Quality Assurance Protocol**
- **TOWER Review**: Strategic assessment of all major reports
- **Cross-Agent Validation**: Technical verification when required
- **Business Impact Assessment**: Revenue and competitive implications
- **Backwards QA**: Historical review of decisions and outcomes

---

## üîÑ **OVERSIGHT COORDINATION**

### **TOWER Oversight Responsibilities**
- **Weekly Strategic Reviews**: Cross-user progress analysis
- **Business Impact Assessment**: Combined output evaluation
- **Resource Optimization**: Prevent duplicate work, maximize efficiency
- **Market Positioning**: Ensure competitive advantage maintenance

### **SECRETARY Administrative Coordination**
- **Daily Progress Tracking**: Mission completion rates across both users
- **Pipeline Management**: Deal flow coordination and handoffs
- **Calendar Integration**: Meeting scheduling and deadline management
- **Accountability Auditing**: Ensure proper mission completion and reporting

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è **CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOLS**

### **Priority Conflicts**
When both users need same resources:
1. **Client deadline proximity** takes precedence
2. **Revenue impact** evaluation for business-critical items
3. **TOWER arbitration** for strategic decisions
4. **Collaborative solution** preferred when possible

### **Technical Disagreements**
1. **Data validation** against authoritative sources
2. **Performance benchmarking** for objective assessment
3. **WINGMAN consultation** for technical disputes
4. **External validation** when internal consensus not reached

### **Coordination Failures**
When cross-user coordination breaks down:
1. **TOWER immediate intervention** with strategic analysis
2. **SECRETARY administrative support** for process issues
3. **Mission priority reassessment** by both STRIKE LEADERs
4. **System process improvement** to prevent recurrence

---

## üéÆ **DAILY OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS**

### **Morning Coordination (Both Users)**
1. **Review overnight progress** from other user's agents
2. **Check shared mission board** for new coordination opportunities
3. **Update SECRETARY** on daily priorities and dependencies
4. **TOWER briefing** on strategic priorities if major decisions needed

### **End-of-Day Handoffs**
1. **File progress reports** for incomplete work
2. **Update mission status** for cross-user visibility
