# Code Notes


## Call with Eduardo August 6, 2025

### To-Do

- Set up a test folder.
- Have a test folder in the main Colosseum directory and within it we have a folder called:
-   1.Integration (where you interact with the database and you rest multiple things)
-   2.End to end (this is a full on test)
- Within each of the folders we will have claude write us best practices for each one
- All of the unit tests go into the folder of the module you are working
- 
To-Do: 
1. Have CC do a TDD report and read about it and upload to shared intelligence
2. Have CC research PRD and read about this and upload to shared intelligence
3. Have CC research tell us what the best way to structure our data is based on our data files? He mentioned S3 and AWS but I have no ida what the options are. Explain to Claude what the data is and how does it recommend we store the data
### Best Practices and Misc Notes and Key Terms

- Install iturn2. It lets you dictate code
- Structured data = same format and consistent information
- Unstructured data = random files
- Pull request â€“ you made a new branch and you want to request to commit these changes to a main branch
- Always write plans followed by tests
- We should be saving all of the code in github which is where the code lives. Every time you work on a new branch, put all the code in github
- Store our data in a database
- Eduardo mentioned something about SQL. Look into this.
- Github is just version control
