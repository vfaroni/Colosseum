# Product Requirements Documents for the Colosseum LIHTC Platform

## Introduction: PRDs as strategic tools for complex software projects

Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) have evolved from static specification handoffs to dynamic strategic tools that guide software development through continuous collaboration and iteration. In 2025, PRDs serve as living blueprints that create shared understanding between business stakeholders and technical teams, particularly crucial for complex platforms like Colosseum that operate within the highly regulated Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) industry.

For a platform addressing the $10.5 billion annual LIHTC market, PRDs become essential navigation tools through regulatory complexity, multi-stakeholder coordination, and sophisticated data integration requirements. The LIHTC ecosystem involves developers navigating 50+ different state allocation processes, syndicators managing investor relationships, and housing authorities ensuring 30-year compliance periods. This environment demands PRDs that balance comprehensive documentation with agile flexibility, enabling teams to build software that scores land sites accurately, generates compliant financial models, and produces reports that meet stringent regulatory standards.

The modern PRD philosophy emphasizes **problem-focused collaboration over prescriptive specifications**, making them ideal for projects like Colosseum where user needs span demographic analysis, environmental assessments, financial projections, and compliance monitoring. By treating PRDs as decision-making frameworks rather than rigid contracts, development teams can adapt to the LIHTC industry's evolving requirements while maintaining clear success criteria and measurable outcomes.

## What a PRD entails: Components and best practices for modern software development

### Core components of effective PRDs

Modern PRDs comprise ten essential components that create comprehensive yet flexible documentation. The **executive summary and objectives** establish clear success metrics tied to business outcomes—for Colosseum, this might include reducing application preparation time by 50% or improving scoring accuracy to capture 90% of successful LIHTC applications. **User personas and scenarios** translate abstract requirements into concrete user journeys, documenting how LIHTC developers navigate from site selection through financial modeling to application submission.

**Features and functionality specifications** detail specific capabilities without prescribing implementation approaches. Rather than dictating database schemas, effective PRDs describe outcomes: "The system shall score potential development sites based on proximity to transit, employment centers, and essential services, with configurable weighting factors that adapt to different state Qualified Allocation Plans." This approach gives developers flexibility while ensuring alignment with user needs.

**Success metrics** move beyond feature completion to business impact measurement. For Colosseum, metrics might include: number of LIHTC applications processed, accuracy of financial projections compared to actual project performance, time saved in application preparation, and compliance violation rates for properties using the platform. These quantifiable outcomes guide development priorities and validate product-market fit.

**Constraints, assumptions, and dependencies** explicitly document the operating environment. LIHTC projects involve complex constraints: minimum 30-year affordability commitments, state-specific scoring criteria, multiple funding source coordination, and strict income verification requirements. Documenting these upfront prevents costly rework and ensures technical architecture supports long-term compliance monitoring.

### Atlassian's agile PRD framework

Industry leader Atlassian advocates for collaborative PRD creation that emphasizes **shared understanding over exhaustive documentation**. Their framework includes project participants and status tracking, team goals linked to business objectives, background context explaining strategic fit, user stories derived from customer research, design explorations with early wireframes, decision tracking tables documenting trade-offs, and explicit "not doing" boundaries that prevent scope creep.

This approach proves particularly valuable for Colosseum, where cross-functional expertise spans affordable housing finance, regulatory compliance, data science, and software engineering. By involving developers and designers from the beginning, PRDs capture technical constraints and opportunities that pure business analysis might miss—such as leveraging machine learning for site scoring optimization or implementing blockchain for immutable compliance records.

### Six-stage PRD evolution lifecycle

Leading practitioners now advocate for sophisticated PRD lifecycles that mirror product development stages. The **aperture phase** aligns leadership on exploring LIHTC technology opportunities. **Discovery** validates specific pain points through interviews with developers, syndicators, and housing authorities. **Define** scopes the problem with clear boundaries—perhaps focusing initially on 9% competitive tax credit applications before expanding to 4% automatic allocations.

The **design phase** explores multiple solution approaches: should Colosseum integrate with existing state portals or provide standalone functionality? The **deliver phase** commits to specific solutions with detailed acceptance criteria. Finally, the **live phase** measures post-launch impact and guides iterative improvements based on real-world usage patterns and regulatory changes.

Best practices emphasize **progressive disclosure through linking** rather than document bloat. Core PRDs remain concise—ideally under five pages—with links to detailed user research, technical specifications, and compliance documentation. This structure enables different stakeholders to access relevant depth without overwhelming casual readers with excessive detail.

## How PRDs facilitate the coding process

### PRDs as developer blueprints

Modern PRDs function as comprehensive blueprints by establishing **shared context rather than prescriptive instructions**. For Colosseum's land scoring algorithms, PRDs would define scoring objectives and data sources without mandating specific implementations. Developers gain flexibility to choose between rule-based scoring engines, machine learning models, or hybrid approaches while maintaining alignment with business goals.

Visual elements significantly improve developer comprehension. Wireframes showing the scoring workflow, data flow diagrams illustrating integration points with demographic databases, and example calculations for financial projections create concrete understanding that textual descriptions alone cannot achieve. These visual aids bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, reducing ambiguity that leads to rework.

PRDs that explain user problems and business context prove more valuable than those prescribing technical solutions. Rather than specifying "implement a PostgreSQL database with specific schemas," effective PRDs describe data relationships: "The system must track ownership structures across multiple funding layers, maintaining audit trails for 30-year compliance periods while enabling real-time financial performance monitoring."

### Integration with development methodologies

In agile environments, PRDs adapt to support **iterative discovery and continuous refinement**. Rather than comprehensive upfront specifications, agile PRDs focus on high-level requirements with details emerging through sprint cycles. For Colosseum, this might mean starting with basic site scoring functionality, then iteratively adding environmental assessments, demographic analysis, and proximity calculations based on user feedback and state-specific requirements.

Feature-level PRDs prove more effective than product-level specifications. Each Colosseum module—site scoring, financial modeling, report generation—receives its own focused PRD that maintains coherence with the overall platform vision while enabling independent development and deployment. This modular approach supports continuous delivery while maintaining system integrity.

The shift from "Product Requirements Documents" to "Feature Documents" reflects modern development realities. Teams create lightweight documents for specific capabilities, emphasizing collaboration over handoff. A Colosseum feature document for cash flow projections would involve financial analysts, developers, and compliance experts working together to define requirements, rather than product managers creating specifications in isolation.

### Tool integration and workflow automation

Modern PRDs integrate seamlessly with development tools through **bidirectional linking and automated workflows**. Jira integration connects user stories in PRDs to specific development tasks, enabling real-time progress tracking. When developers complete scoring algorithm implementation, the PRD automatically updates to reflect completion status, triggering notifications to stakeholders awaiting dependent features.

GitHub integration enables code-requirement traceability. Developers link commits and pull requests to specific PRD requirements, creating audit trails from business need through technical implementation. For Colosseum's compliance-critical features, this traceability proves essential for demonstrating regulatory adherence and managing long-term maintenance.

Automated workflows reduce administrative overhead while improving consistency. GitHub Actions can validate PRD formatting, ensure required sections exist, and check for stakeholder approvals before merging changes. These automations free teams to focus on substance rather than process, particularly valuable for complex projects with multiple contributors.

## Implementing PRDs for the Colosseum platform

### Identifying and understanding LIHTC stakeholders

Successful PRD implementation begins with **comprehensive stakeholder mapping** across the LIHTC ecosystem. **Developers** require tools for efficient application preparation, from initial site evaluation through financial modeling to final submission. Their PRD input emphasizes workflow automation, data accuracy, and integration with existing systems. Key personas include small nonprofit developers managing 2-3 projects annually and large for-profit developers with 20+ project pipelines.

**Tax credit syndicators** need portfolio management capabilities, investor reporting tools, and risk assessment features. Their requirements focus on standardized data collection, automated compliance monitoring, and performance benchmarking across multiple properties. PRDs must capture their role as intermediaries, balancing developer relationships with investor expectations while managing complex fee structures and long-term asset management obligations.

**Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs)** represent the regulatory perspective, requiring transparent scoring methodologies, standardized application formats, and robust compliance tracking. While not direct platform users, their requirements shape system design through data export formats, reporting standards, and audit trail capabilities. Understanding their 50+ different state-specific Qualified Allocation Plans proves essential for creating flexible, configurable scoring algorithms.

### Outlining PRD sections for core Colosseum features

#### Data scoring algorithm PRD structure

The site scoring module PRD requires specialized sections addressing **multi-dimensional evaluation criteria**. Algorithm requirements must specify data sources (census demographics, environmental databases, transit APIs), scoring methodologies (weighted factors, threshold requirements, bonus categories), and configurability needs (state-specific QAP variations, annual updates, custom criteria).

Performance requirements demand sub-second scoring for individual sites and batch processing for portfolio evaluation. The PRD must specify acceptable accuracy tolerances, data freshness requirements, and fallback strategies for missing data. Transparency requirements include score explanation capabilities, audit trails for scoring changes, and exportable documentation for application attachments.

Integration specifications cover connections to GIS systems, demographic databases, and environmental data providers. The PRD documents API requirements, data synchronization frequencies, and error handling strategies. Security considerations address sensitive location data, competitive intelligence protection, and compliance with fair housing regulations.

#### Financial modeling logic specifications

Financial modeling PRDs require **comprehensive coverage of LIHTC's unique requirements**. The document must specify calculation engines for eligible basis determination, tax credit projections over 10-year claim periods, and 15-year cash flow analysis with partnership waterfalls. Multiple funding source integration demands flexible model architecture supporting construction loans, permanent debt, gap financing, and various soft funding sources.

Scenario analysis capabilities enable sensitivity testing across key variables: construction costs, interest rates, rent growth, operating expenses, and exit cap rates. The PRD specifies required scenarios (base case, upside, downside, stress test) and output formats for different stakeholders. Version control requirements ensure model assumption tracking and facilitate collaborative refinement throughout project development.

Compliance constraints shape model design through income averaging requirements, rent restriction calculations, and recapture risk assessment. The PRD documents regulatory calculation methods, required compliance reserves, and monitoring period obligations. Export requirements support various stakeholder needs: detailed Excel models for developers, summary reports for investors, and standardized formats for state agencies.

#### Report generation workflow documentation

Report generation PRDs address **diverse stakeholder communication needs** throughout the LIHTC lifecycle. Application reports require dynamic assembly of scoring results, financial projections, and supporting documentation into state-specific formats. The PRD specifies template management systems, data mapping requirements, and quality control checkpoints.

Investor reporting workflows demand standardized quarterly and annual formats, automated data collection from property management systems, and exception reporting for compliance issues. The PRD documents calculation methodologies for investor returns, tax benefit schedules, and cash distribution waterfalls. Visualization requirements include dashboard designs, trend analysis charts, and portfolio performance comparisons.

Compliance reporting represents the most complex workflow, with requirements for annual owner certifications, tenant income verification summaries, and physical inspection results. The PRD must specify data retention policies (minimum 30 years), audit trail requirements, and integration with state agency reporting systems. Automated alert systems notify stakeholders of upcoming deadlines, potential violations, and corrective action requirements.

### Best practices for LIHTC platform development

User research drives PRD creation through **systematic investigation of LIHTC stakeholder needs**. Shadowing developers through application processes reveals pain points in data gathering, scoring interpretation, and document assembly. Syndicator interviews uncover portfolio management challenges, investor communication requirements, and compliance monitoring gaps. State agency feedback ensures regulatory alignment and identifies integration opportunities.

Iterative refinement based on user feedback prevents costly pivots late in development. Initial PRDs focus on core functionality—perhaps starting with site scoring for a single state—then expand based on validated user needs. Regular stakeholder review sessions validate assumptions, test prototypes, and guide feature prioritization. This approach proves particularly valuable given LIHTC's state-specific variations and evolving regulatory landscape.

Scalability planning for sensitive housing data requires **architectural decisions documented in PRDs**. Data privacy requirements mandate encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access controls, and audit logging for all data access. Multi-tenancy considerations ensure data isolation between competing developers while enabling portfolio-level analytics for syndicators. Performance requirements anticipate growth from initial pilots to nationwide deployment.

### Addressing regulatory compliance challenges

LIHTC's regulatory complexity demands **specialized PRD sections for compliance management**. Requirements must address federal Section 42 regulations, state-specific QAP variations, and overlapping funding source requirements. The PRD documents compliance checking workflows, exception handling procedures, and corrective action tracking systems.

Data retention and audit trail requirements reflect 30-year compliance periods plus statute of limitations extensions. PRDs specify immutable record-keeping, version-controlled document storage, and chain-of-custody tracking for critical compliance documents. Integration with IRS Form 8823 reporting ensures standardized noncompliance documentation.

Privacy and fair housing considerations shape data handling requirements. PRDs document personally identifiable information (PII) protection, demographic data aggregation rules, and fair housing testing procedures. Accessibility requirements ensure ADA compliance for both platform interfaces and generated reports.

### Tools and templates for Colosseum implementation

**Markdown-based PRDs in GitHub** provide version control, collaborative editing, and developer-friendly formats. The recommended structure includes standardized templates for each module (scoring, modeling, reporting), automated validation through GitHub Actions, and integration with development workflows. Pull request templates ensure consistent review processes, while branch protection rules maintain document integrity.

**Monday Dev** offers visual project management with native GitHub integration, customizable workflows for PRD approval processes, and automated status synchronization with development boards. Custom fields capture LIHTC-specific metadata, while automation rules notify stakeholders of updates and required actions.

**Specialized templates** address Colosseum's unique requirements. Data platform templates include sections for ingestion sources, quality requirements, and regulatory considerations. Financial modeling templates specify calculation methodologies, scenario requirements, and audit trail needs. Compliance templates document retention policies, reporting workflows, and exception handling procedures.
