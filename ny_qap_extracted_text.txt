## I.  INTRODUCTION

Since 1988 the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development ('HPD' or 'Agency') has been making direct allocations of Low Income Housing Tax Credits to eligible projects in New York City by  mutual  agreement  with  New  York  State  Homes  and  Community  Renewal  (HCR).    Under  procedures authorized by federal statute and state law, HPD is officially designated by HCR as a Local Housing Credit Agency, a designation that is renewed annually.

As a Housing Credit Agency, HPD is required to make allocations according to a "Qualified Allocation Plan" (the Plan), which may be adopted only after providing opportunity for public comment and gaining approval of the Mayor.  HPD's Plan was first issued and received mayoral approval in 1990.  The Plan was found by NYC Corporation Counsel to be consistent with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (the 'Code') and was approved by HCR as consistent with the 1990 State of New York Allocation Plan. HPD reserves the right to  modify  the  QAP  annually,  with  the  consent  of  the  Mayor  of  City  of  New  York.  HPD  may  make  technical clarifications or revisions to comply with changes in federal law at its sole discretion.

Modifications have been made to the Plan as needed in response to federal law and industry practice.  In 1991, HPD made several  changes  to  facilitate  the  administration  of  its  Tax  Credit  Program  and  to  ensure  that amendments required by the 1990 Federal Budget Reconciliation Act were incorporated into the Plan.  In 1993, a description of compliance monitoring procedures was incorporated into the Plan, as was required under new IRS regulations that became effective that year.  In 1998, in response to changes in federal law, HPD made additional changes in the Compliance Monitoring section of the Plan, as well as changes in sections dealing with  Administrative  Processes,  Selection  Criteria  and  Project  Underwriting.    The  1999  revisions  included changes in the Selection Criteria and Project Underwriting sections of the Plan.  For 2000, minor changes and clarifications were made in sections on Administrative Processes, Selection Criteria, Project Underwriting, and Compliance Monitoring.    In  2001,  several  sections  of  the  Plan  (Administrative  Processes,  Assessment  of Housing  Needs,  Selection  Criteria,  and  Compliance  Monitoring)  were  revised  in  response  to  federal  rule changes.    No  substantive  changes  were  made  for  2002  or  2003.    In  2004,  changes  were  made  to  the Administrative Process, Selection Criteria, and Project Underwriting sections of the Plan.  No substantive changes were made for 2005.  For 2006, changes were made to the Administrative Process, Selection Criteria and  Project  Underwriting  sections  of  the  Plan.    In  2007,  a  number  of  sections  of  the  Plan  were  updated including Administrative Process, Project Financing and Development Costs, Competitive Criteria, Project Underwriting, and Compliance Monitoring.  Changes in 2008 were made in Administrative Process, Threshold and Competitive Criteria, and Project Underwriting.  In 2009, substantive changes were made to Competitive Criteria.  For 2010, changes were made to the Administrative Process, Selection Criteria, Project Underwriting and Compliance Monitoring sections of the Plan.  In 2011, changes were made to the Administrative Process, Selection  Criteria,  Project  Underwriting  and  Competitive  Criteria.  In  2012,  changes  were  made  to  the Administrative Process,  Selection Criteria,  Underwriting and Competitive Criteria.  In 2013, changes were made to the Administrative Process and Selection Criteria. In 2014, changes were made to the Assessment of Housing Needs, Threshold and Competitive Criteria sections. In 2015, changes were made to the Threshold and Competitive Criteria and Underwriting sections.  In 2016, changes were made the to the Threshold and Competitive Criteria sections.   In 2017, changes were made to the Threshold and Competitive Criteria sections. In 2018, changes are being made to the Assessment of Housing Needs and Competitive Criteria.  In 2019, changes were made to the Selection Criteria, Project Underwriting and Compliance Monitoring sections. In 2020, no changes were made.  In 2021, changes were made to the Competitive Criteria. In 2022 and 2023, changes were made to the Threshold Criteria and competitive criteria.

The Plan presented herein sets forth the goals and administrative procedures to be undertaken by HPD in allocating credits to projects, including application submission, evaluation and selection criteria, standards to be  used  in  underwriting  credit  amounts  and  monitoring  compliance  pursuant  to  Section  42  of  the  Code ('Section 42').  This Plan fully conforms to Section 42 and State Executive Order 11.

## II. CREDIT ALLOCATION AUTHORITY

HPD has a long and successful history as a provider of housing assistance including direct subsidies for the construction, substantial rehabilitation, and moderate rehabilitation of affordable residential buildings.  The Agency also administers the City's housing code and acts as a Public Housing Agency in order to provide Federal tenant-based rent subsidies through the Section 8 Voucher program. Together these activities constitute far and away the largest locally sponsored housing program in the nation.

HPD also has substantial experience in awarding and administering the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program.  Since 1988, HPD has served as a Local Housing Credit Agency.  By the end of calendar year 2022, HPD had cumulatively awarded nearly $1.25B in tax credits to create or rehabilitate nearly 112,900 low income units.  (The $1.25B figure represents annual allocation amounts that are repeated for 10 years, or $12.5B in total credits.  These credits resulted in over $1.25B of direct private equity investments in low-income housing.)

As  in  the  past,  HPD  will  work  cooperatively  with  HCR  by  furnishing  periodic  reports  and  summary information on the administration of its tax credit program.  In addition, where HCR receives a proposal for projects  located  in  HPD's  five-county  New  York  metropolitan  jurisdiction,  HCR  will  notify  HPD  of  the proposal prior to making their decision to allocate credit to the project.  Any unused New York City credit authority (i.e., credit authority for which no funding reservation has been issued) will be returned to HCR. Should HPD exhaust its allocation of credit authority, the Agency may request additional authority from the statewide pool of recaptured credit or from any national pool credits available.

## III. GEOGRAPHIC JURISDICTION

HPD's allocation authority covers the entire City of New York, comprised of the five counties of New York, Kings, Queens, the Bronx, and Richmond.  However, selection criteria will target  neighborhoods with the greatest need or ability to provide residents with significant opportunities for better education, access to jobs and quality of life.

## IV. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR CREDIT ALLOCATIONS

The allocation of Low Income Housing Tax Credits is administered by HPD's Tax Credit Unit within the Division of Tax Credits and Discretionary Incentives. Tax Credit and federal HOME Program ('HOME') compliance monitoring is administered by the Tax Credit and HOME Compliance Unit within the Division of Asset Management.  Specifically, the Tax Credit Unit is responsible for evaluating, underwriting, and scoring applications for tax credits, issuing determinations, reservations and allocations, and maintaining the waiting list.    The  Tax  Credit  and  HOME  Compliance  Unit  is  charged  with  monitoring  compliance  of  tax  credit recipients with Federal tax credit regulations.

Annually, HPD will publish a Notice of Credit Availability in a local publication that informs applicants of submission dates and deadlines for future funding rounds.  One or more funding rounds may be held each year in which credit allocations will be awarded on a competitive basis.  HPD may establish set-asides of credit for projects that meet qualifications determined by the Agency to be current housing priorities.  Specific details regarding set-asides, including amounts and eligibility requirements, will be published in the annual Notice of Credit Availability.    Projects  will  be  evaluated  under  the  general  pool  unless  the  application  specifies  the project is applying under an established set-aside.

Pursuant to Section 42, at least 10% of the credits will be allocated to projects that involve a qualified nonprofit organization  (a  'Qualified  Nonprofit  Organization').    As  set  forth  in  Section  42,  a  Qualified  Nonprofit Organization: a) is tax exempt under Section 501(a) and described in either paragraph (3) or (4) of Section 501(c); b) has the fostering of low income housing as one of its purposes; and c)  is not affiliated with or controlled by a for-profit organization.  The Qualified Nonprofit Organization must materially participate in the development and ownership of the project throughout the compliance period.  Material participation shall mean being the managing general partner of the owner.

To receive consideration for a credit allocation, project owners must submit an application on or before the published submission deadline.  Application forms may be obtained from the HPD website: www.nyc.gov/hpd. Applications must be completed in their entirety, and the required supporting documentation must be attached. The Agency may reject any application that is incomplete.

## The following fees apply:

- 1) A non-refundable fee will be charged for filing an electronic application for an allocation of credits from HPD's credit authority (9% applications).  The fee shall be $1,000 for projects that involve a qualified  nonprofit  organization  and  $2,000  for  projects  that  do  not  involve  a  qualified  nonprofit organization.  A nonprofit organization must have at minimum 50% ownership in the General Partner and receive at minimum 50% of the distributions in order to qualify to pay the nonprofit application fee. Fees must be paid at the time the application is submitted to HPD.
- 2) A non-refundable fee will be charged for filing an electronic application for 'as-of-right' 4% credits (for projects with tax-exempt bond financing).  The fee shall be $2,000 for projects that involve a qualified  nonprofit  organization  and  $3,000  for  projects  that  do  not  involve  a  qualified  nonprofit organization.  A non-profit organization must have at minimum 50% ownership in the General Partner and receive at minimum 50% of the distributions in order to qualify to pay the non-profit application fee.  Fees must be paid at the time the application is submitted to HPD.
- 3) A non-refundable Allocation Fee of 8% of the requested credit amount will be collected at two stages. For allocations of credits from HPD's credit authority, one half of the fee (4%) must be received before HPD will issue the Carryover Allocation.  The second half of the fee (4%) must be received before HPD will issue the final Certification ('8609').  For 'as-of-right' credit, one half of the fee (4%) must be received before HPD will issue a 'determination of credit eligibility' (DOCE) letter.  The second half of the fee (4%) must be received before HPD will issue the final Certification ('8609').
- 4) A non-refundable Carryover Allocation extension fee of $5,000 will be charged for any project that requests  and  is  granted  an  extension  beyond  the  administrative  deadline  to  submit  a  completed application for a Carryover Allocation.  Carryover extension requests will be valid for a maximum of three months and will be approved solely at the discretion of HPD.  HPD will not issue a Carryover Allocation extension beyond November 15 th of any year.
- 5) A non-refundable Compliance Monitoring Fee will be charged. The current Compliance Monitoring Fee is $25 per tax credit unit per year.  However, the fee schedule is subject to change and owners are required to confirm the appropriate fee.  The Compliance Fee is indicated on the Compliance Fee Form  located  at:    http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdf/LIHTC/Compliance-MonitoringFee-Form.pdf
- 6) A non-refundable fee of $2,000 per week will be charged for each week (or part thereof) that initial applications, requests for determination of credit eligibility, Carryover Allocations, Form 8609's, and

other documentation required by HPD, are submitted beyond the due date or are incomplete.  For the purposes of calculating the fee, a document will not be deemed submitted until the complete document is submitted.  HPD may elect not to impose this fee in specific instances if, in HPD's sole discretion, it determines there is good cause for the document being submitted late or incomplete.

- 7) A non-refundable expedited Financial Update for 8609 fee of $7,500 per project will be charged for any project that requests and is granted an expedited 8609.  A cure letter will be sent to the applicant within one week of receipt of the 8609 request.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure all outstanding cure items are submitted to HPD expeditiously. The Tax Credit Unit will issue the 8609 within 4 weeks of the date on which it determines the Financial Update is complete. The Tax Credit Unit will not accept requests to expedite 8609s between December 1 st and March 31 st .
- 8) A non-refundable 8609 extension fee of $10,000 will be charged for any project that requests and is granted an extension beyond the administrative deadline to submit a completed Financial Update for 8609.  8609 extension requests will be valid for a maximum of one year and will be issued solely at the discretion of HPD.  Waivers may be issued at the sole discretion of HPD.  The annual submission window for 8609 submissions is April 1 st through November 30 th for 4% and 9% projects.

Extension fees, expedite fees and late fees may not be  included in a project's development or conversion budget.  All fees are non-refundable.

HPD may request any and all information it deems necessary for project evaluation.  If any submission is incomplete or if documentation is insufficient to complete any evaluation of the proposed project, processing will be suspended.  HPD will notify applicants of how the submission is incomplete and provide at least ten business days for the applicant to submit the requested documentation.  The application will be disqualified and the package will be returned if the applicant fails to submit the requested documentation within the required period.

Tax credit applications and requests for information should be submitted to:

Tax Credit Unit NYC Dept. of Housing Preservation and Development 100 Gold Street, Section 9-Y New York, N.Y.  10038 (212) 863-5184

Tax Credit and HOME compliance inquiries should be submitted to:

Tax Credit and HOME Compliance Unit NYC Dept. of Housing Preservation and Development 100 Gold Street, Section 7-X2 New York, N.Y.  10038 (212) 863-7615

Tax credits will be awarded based upon the selection criteria outlined in Section VI of this document.  Unless otherwise indicated in the Qualified Allocation Plan, applications will be evaluated and underwritten according to the guidelines in effect during the year a complete tax credit application is submitted to HPD.

Sponsors and developers whose action or inaction materially contributed to the return or recapture of credits previously allocated by HPD will be prohibited for three years from the date the credits were returned or

recaptured from participation in any project applying for credits.  The Commissioner of HPD may waive the prohibition where there is valid cause.

Applications for competitive credits received by the submission deadline will be reviewed for completeness and basic eligibility.  Those that meet the threshold eligibility criteria will be scored to determine competitive ranking and underwritten to determine the maximum amount of credits for which they are eligible.  Credit reservations will then be issued, in rank order, to as many projects as can be covered by the credit authority available in a given funding round.  In the event of scoring ties, HPD will rank tied projects according to which require the least number of tax credit dollars per tax credit unit.  After that, HPD reserves the right to select the last  project or projects to be funded based on whose credit needs most closely approximate the remaining available credit. HPD reserves the right to set a minimum score each year.

Notwithstanding a project's competitive score, HPD may limit the number of awards to a developer in a given year, or make no awards to a developer if, in HPD's judgment, the developer does not have the current capacity to successfully complete any or all of the projects for which the applications have been submitted.  In addition, HPD reserves the right not to commit tax credits to any project if it determines, in its sole discretion, that a reservation for such project does not further the goals set forth in the City's housing plan and shall have the power  to  allocate  credits  to  a  project  irrespective  of  its  point  ranking,  if  such  intended  allocation  is:  in compliance with the Code; in furtherance of the City's housing goals; and determined by the commissioner to be in the interests of the citizens of the City of New York. A written explanation shall be available to the general public for any allocation of a housing credit dollar amount which is not made in accordance with established priorities and the selection criteria set forth herein.

Any  complete  9%  application  which  meets  the  eligibility  review  criteria  but  is  not  selected  for  a  credit reservation will be placed on a waiting list to ensure a continuous flow of quality projects should additional credit authority become available before the next funding round. The waiting list will be terminated at the commencement of a new funding round.

The allocation of tax credits under HPD's credit authority will proceed as outlined below.  Applicants will be notified in writing of the status of their application, and of any conditions to be met in order to proceed to subsequent stages of the allocation process.

## ALLOCATION STEPS - APPLICATIONS FOR CREDITS UNDER HPD'S CREDIT AUTHORITY

- 1) Initial Review &amp; Evaluation Applications are accepted, reviewed for completeness, evaluated against threshold and competitive selection criteria and underwritten.  If sufficient credits are available to fund the project in the current funding round, it proceeds to the Credit Reservation stage (below).
- 2) Credit  Reservation  Agreement  Reservations  will  be  executed  for  projects  selected  during  periodic funding rounds.  The reservation document serves as a binding commitment.  Applicants who execute Credit Reservation Agreements "lock in" the credit percentage rate for the month and year in which the agreement is made.
- 3) Carryover Allocation Projects requiring credit allocations prior to completion of construction will be issued a Carryover Allocation if they meet all of the following requirements:
- a) Evidence is provided that 10% of the project's reasonably expected basis will be incurred by the close of the calendar year for which the allocation is made (or by such earlier date as HPD may, for administrative purposes, establish),

- b) Evidence is provided that all financing commitments have been executed (for loans included in basis, no forgiveness or grant language can be included),
- c) The project will be placed in service no later than the close of the second calendar year following the year of the allocation,

Prior to Certification of Allocation (8609), if project ownership changes, entities will be required to submit at minimum:

- a)   Information regarding the old ownership structure
- b)  Legal documents for the new ownership structure, and
- c)  Proof that all restrictive covenants and regulatory agreements are in full force and effect with the new ownership entity.
- 4) Certification of Allocation (8609) Projects must have converted to permanent financing before they are eligible to submit for 8609. Certification  of  the  final  credit  amount  will  be  issued  after projects are placed in service and converted to permanent financing.  The certification will be in the form of an IRS Form 8609 to be issued by the Agency on a per building basis.  To request the 8609, project owners must submit a "Financial Update" and such other documentation as HPD may require. The submission must be received no later than November 30 th of the second calendar year following the placed in service date (i.e. placed-in service date 12/31/2020, 8609 submission must be received within the April 1 st through November 30th submission window in 2022).  Prior to issuance of 8609, applicants must submit the final Enterprise Green Communities Certification, if applicable.  All final executed and recorded legal and loan documents, including final permanent loan documents, supporting the information represented in the Financial Update must be submitted prior to issuance of 8609.  For multi-building  projects,  the  Regulatory  Agreement  must  include  a  schedule  that  includes  the  total number of units and total number of tax credit units per building. All Regulatory Agreements must include a waiver of the right to seek a qualified contract to purchase the project at the end of the 15year  compliance  period.  (see  Threshold  Criteria  for  requirements).  Applications  for  8609  will  be accepted between April 1 st and November 30 th .  Any project unable to meet this timeline requirement must request an 8609 extension and pay the appropriate extension fee.

## ALLOCATION STEPS - APPLICATIONS FOR 'AS-OF-RIGHT' CREDITS FOR TAX EXEMPT BOND FINANCED PROJECTS

Rental projects which meet the rent, income and occupancy requirements of Section 42, and for which more than 50% of aggregate basis is financed by tax exempt bond financing may qualify for 'as-of-right' allocations of tax credits which are not charged against the credit ceiling of either HPD or the State of New York.  Such projects must apply to a Housing Credit Agency for two purposes: (a) for a determination that the project satisfies the threshold requirements for an allocation under the qualified allocation plan applicable to the area in which the project is located, and (b) for a determination of the amount of tax credits to be allocated to the project.  Applications for 'as-of-right' credit allocations will be subject to such administrative deadlines as HPD may establish, and to the same threshold requirements (except as specified in Section VI of this document) and underwriting guidelines as apply to applications for credits under HPD's credit authority.  Unless otherwise indicated  in  the  Qualified  Allocation  Plan,  applications  are  evaluated  and  underwritten  according  to  the guidelines in effect during the year a complete tax credit application is submitted to HPD.

As-of-right projects must apply for and receive a Determination of Credit Eligibility (DOCE) from the Agency

prior to commencement of construction. The Commissioner of HPD may waive this requirement where there is valid cause.

Projects that apply to HPD for 'as-of-right' allocations shall be processed as follows:

- 1) Initial Review &amp; Evaluation Applications are accepted, reviewed for completeness, evaluated against threshold criteria (but not competitive criteria) and underwritten.  (See Section VI 'Selection Criteria", and Section VII "Project Underwriting".) Applications must be submitted a minimum of 8 weeks prior to the anticipated closing date.  Late submissions are required to pay a $2,000 per week late fee.
- 2) Determination of Credit Eligibility (DOCE) - Projects found to be eligible shall receive a DOCE, which is a non-binding statement of the amount of credit for which the project is eligible.  The DOCE will also list conditions and requirements for obtaining an allocation.  Once a DOCE has been issued by HPD, the owner may elect to lock in a credit rate for the month in which the bonds are issued, by executing and returning to HPD an original statement to that effect, along with evidence of the date of bond issuance.  The credit rate lock form must be executed and delivered to HPD's Tax Credit Unit directly no later than the fifth day after the close of the month during which the tax-exempt bonds are issued.  (For example, if bonds are issued June 15 th , HPD's Tax Credit Unit must receive the credit rate lock form no later than July 5 th ).  It is the responsibility of the Applicant to ensure that HPD receives the  original  rate  lock  form  within  the  required  timeframe.  Applicants  must  submit  a  Letter  of Satisfaction from Enterprise Green Communities prior to issuance of the DOCE letter, if applicable.

## V.  ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING NEEDS

Providing decent and affordable housing is a constant challenge throughout the State of New York. New York City is faced with an extreme shortage of  low-cost housing units.  This shortage has led tens of thousands to become homeless and forced many mores to "double-up" in overcrowded homes or to settle for substandard accommodations.  In addition, many of those who have found decent living conditions are paying excessive portions  of  their  income  for  rent  and  consequently  may  be  in  jeopardy  of  being  displaced  themselves. Predictably, low and very low-income families are the hardest hit.

Data from the 2021 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey (NYCHVS) reveal numerous critical housing issues with which the City must contend.  The HVS, conducted periodically by the U.S. Census Bureau for HPD, provides data on the housing inventory in New York City, including the condition of the rental housing stock, vacancy rates, rent levels, and ownership trends. The 2021 HVS reveals:

- More than half of renter households, or just under 1 million households, were rent burdened, paying more than 30 percent of their income on rent; one-third were severely burdened, paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent.
- The overall vacancy rate for rental housing in New York City in 2021 was less than 5% with vacancies concentrated among higher-cost rental units.  For units renting under $1500, the vacancy rate was less than 1%; while for units renting above $2,300 the vacancy rate was 12.64%.
- The proportion of renter households that were crowded in 2017 was 11.5%.

Consistent with the Fair Housing Act, the City implements a balanced approach to fair housing planning by taking  meaningful  actions  to  address  disparities  in  housing  needs,  increase  access  to  opportunity,  foster inclusive  communities,  and  facilitate  integrated  living  patterns,  in  addition  to  combating  discrimination, throughout New York City. The City has demonstrated its firm commitment to fair housing by moving forward with a robust fair housing planning process and publishing the final Where We Live NYC plan in October 2020. The City continues to implement the plan's goals, strategies, and actions.

The  Low  Income  Housing  Tax  Credit,  one  of  the  federal  incentives  created  to  stimulate  private  sector participation in low-income housing production, has been and will be an essential tool for meeting housing needs in New York City. While those needs are extremely broad, the limited availability of tax credit resources dictates that they be targeted to specific housing needs, as set forth below:

- 1) Projects  that  include  a  high  percentage  of  low-income  units,  particularly  those  that  provide  rents affordable to persons of very low and extremely low incomes.
- 2) Projects that convert City owned land or buildings that are difficult to develop or are in the City's Third Party Transfer or Multifamily Preservation Loan programs to private ownership.
- 3) Projects  that  create  permanent  housing  for  special  populations  (homeless  families  with  children, homeless individuals, the homeless mentally ill, other homeless groups, seniors, persons with AIDS, and mentally and/or physically disabled), and provide training and/or support services necessary to make the transition to independent living.
- 4) Projects that meet neighborhood-based priorities to advance fair housing, including projects that create or preserve affordable housing in areas with limited low-cost housing and in concerted community revitalization areas.
- 5) Projects that are developed by M/WBE  developers  and  developers demonstrating diversity participation in their business practices.
- 6) Projects that attract or retain HPD subsidies.
- 7) Projects  that  meet  or  exceed  the  Enterprise  Green  Communities  Criteria,  if  applicable,  and

- Benchmarking requirements.
- 8) Projects that agree to provide the City with an option to extend the affordability period beyond the initial 30 years.
- 9) Projects that have plans to encourage stability and prevent evictions among their tenants.

A more detailed discussion of the City's priorities in awarding credit authority is included in the following section.

## VI. SELECTION CRITERIA

As a Local Housing Credit Agency, HPD will evaluate all applications received to determine which projects should receive tax credits.  (Note:  Tax exempt bond financed projects which qualify for 'as-of-right' credit allocations  must  still  be  in  conformance  with  the  threshold  requirements  of  the  qualified  allocation  plan applicable to the area in which the project is located.)

## THRESHOLD CRITERIA

To be considered for funding, a project must demonstrate that it meets each of the following threshold criteria:

1. Rent and Income Restrictions - Project conforms to the income, occupancy and rent restrictions of Section 42.
2. Readiness - Project is ready to proceed as documented by the following:
- a) If the property is currently owned by the applicant or a related entity, applicant must submit a copy of an executed deed to the applicant or related entity;
- b) If  the  property  is  currently  owned  by  a  private  party  and  is  not  in  foreclosure  or  the  subject  of  a foreclosure sale, applicant must submit an unexpired contract of sale between the current owner and the applicant or related entity, or unexpired purchase option in favor of the applicant or related entity;
- c) If the property is currently owned by the City of New York, then ULURP certification must have been obtained as of the time of application for the disposition of the property for the land use contemplated by the project and full ULURP approval must be obtained within 40 days of submission of application;
- d) If the proposed development is not as-of-right, ULURP certification for the required zoning amendment must have been obtained and full ULURP approval for the zoning amendment must be obtained within 40 days of submission of application;
- e) If the property is currently owned by a governmental entity other than the City, applicant must submit evidence satisfactory to HPD that the governmental entity has the authority to convey the property to applicant or a related entity;
- f) The property is or is contemplated to be in the City's Third Party Transfer Program and the proposed use  of  the  property  is  consistent  with  the  City  Council's  approval  for  the  Third  Party  Transfer conveyance.
- g) If the property is currently owned by a private party and is the subject of a mortgage foreclosure, then

the following is required):

- i) If the foreclosure sale has taken place, applicant must provide an executed Memorandum of Sale including the Terms of Sale and showing either the applicant as the successful bidder at the foreclosure sale or an assignment of bid to the applicant as assignee of the successful bidder, as the entity that will ultimately close title with the foreclosure referee.
2. (ii) If a judgment of foreclosure has been granted and entered but the foreclosure sale has not yet taken place, the applicant must be either the foreclosure judgment-creditor or the assignee of the foreclosure judgment-creditor and must submit the judgment of foreclosure and sale and a letter of intent  stating that the applicant intends to serve and publish a Notice of Sale within thirty days of entry of the judgment and to credit bid up to the full amount of the foreclosure judgment and will close title with the foreclosure referee.
3. (iii) If a judgment of foreclosure and sale has not yet been granted and entered, applicant must be the owner of the Note and Mortgage and submit evidence consisting of a) the applicant being owner  of  the  Note  and  Mortgage  and  b)  the  decision  and  order  that  summary  or  default judgment of foreclosure and order of reference has been granted to the mortgagee and c) a statement of intent that the applicant as the Note and Mortgage owner intends to pursue the foreclosure through Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale, serve and publish a Notice of Sale within thirty days of the entry of the foreclosure judgment and credit bid up to the full amount of the judgment.

In  all  instances,  the  project  must  meet  the  HPD  program  requirements.   The  Tax  Credit  Unit  will confirm  that  all  requirements  have  been  met.   HPD  has  the  right  to  approve  the  members  of  the assignee.  If title does not close with the foreclosure referee within a reasonable period of time, as determined by HPD, the application may be declared void at HPD's discretion.

3. Financing commitments:  At minimum, project must be able to demonstrate:

For 'competitive' applications, evidence may include 'soft' or conditional commitment letters indicating intent to provide funding.  The commitment letter must be dated no more than one year prior to the application deadline and must not be expired. For 'as-of-right' applications, evidence of executed construction financing commitment is required for financing issued by New York City Housing Development Corporation.  There must be a provision of evidence, satisfactory to HPD, that the mortgage securing the tax-exempt bond financing will remain on the project in an amount not less than 50% of the aggregate basis at least until the date required by the Internal Revenue Service in order for the project to meet the '50% test'.  For other financing sources, evidence may include 'soft' or conditional commitment letters indicating intent to provide funding.

All  commitments  must  be  on  company  letterhead,  executed  and  contain  a  dollar  amount.    All developments must demonstrate that sufficient sources are available to the project to assure feasibility.

4. Ownership  Structure  -  All  entities  in  the  ownership  structure  are  identified,  including,  for partnerships,  all  proposed  general  partners  and  managing  general  partners  and,  for  limited liability companies, all members and managing members.
5. Regulatory Agreement / Extended Low Income Use / Waiver of Right to Qualified Contract Owners of 9% projects are willing to enter into a 30 year regulatory agreement with HPD for extended low-income use of the project that is in conformance with the requirements of

- Section 42. Owner also agrees to give HPD the option to extend the affordability period for an additional number of years, up to 30 years, if HPD extends the Project's tax exemption for an equal number of years.  Owner agrees to maintain the Extended Use period by including in the regulatory agreement a waiver of the right to seek a qualified contract to purchase the project at the end of the 15-year compliance period.
6. Owners of 4% projects are willing to enter into a regulatory agreement with HPD for extended low-income use of the project (i.e. a 30 year compliance period) that is in conformance with the requirements of Section 42.  Owner agrees to maintain the Extended Use period by including in the regulatory agreement a waiver of the right to seek a qualified contract to purchase the project at the end of the 15-year compliance period.
7. Housing Needs - Project is of the appropriate type needed to address the housing needs in the area where the project is located as evidenced by a market study produced by HPD or a market study consultant approved by HPD.  The market study must demonstrate a need for the proposed housing.
8. Design Standards and Minimum Construction Requirements - 'Standalone' projects (projects receiving 9% credits and no other public capital subsidies  or assistance) must adhere to HPD design  standards  and  will  be  subject  to  post-construction  audit.    HPD's  Building  and  Land Development Services (BLDS) will make a determination of compliance with HPD's Design Standards.
9. Marketing Requirements - All projects, including 'standalone' projects, are subject to HPD's marketing requirements including the selection of initial tenants through an HPD supervised lottery.  The Tax Credit Unit will notify the HPD Marketing Unit when an allocation of credits is made to a 'standalone' project.
10. Applicant  Qualifications  -  Applications  may  be  rejected  at  any  time  during  or  after  the evaluation  process  if  there  are  any  adverse  findings  regarding  the  Applicant,  any  entity  or individual  associated  with  the  Applicant,  or  any  property  owned  and/or  managed  by  them. Applicant and sponsor must certify that there are no such adverse findings, which may include, but are not limited to:
- conviction, administrative violation, judicial or administrative finding, pending judicial or administrative case, or pending litigation for harassment, arson, fraud, bribery, grand larceny, any felony or crime of dishonesty, or noncompliance with fair housing or antidiscrimination laws, any applicable codes or ordinances, labor laws, or construction laws.
- defaults or poor performance under any government-assisted program;
- tax arrears, tax foreclosure or enforcement proceedings, or sale of tax liens;
- voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings;
- suspension or debarment by any government entity
- mortgage arrears, default or foreclosure proceedings; or
- negative findings by the Department of Investigations.

## Defaults under any City-sponsored program,

- i) Applicants or principals with defaults that have current Agency-approved remediation plans in place at the time the project applies for tax credits will pass threshold.  However, competitive points may be deducted from the project's score.

- The applicant must submit a statement from the appropriate agency showing the agreement is in good standing.
- ii) Applicants or principals with defaults that do not have Agency-approved remediation plans in place at the time the project applies for tax credits will not pass threshold.

Applicants  for  'standalone'  projects  must  complete  HPD  Sponsor  Review  Disclosure Statements.    The  Applicant  is  responsible  for  completing  all  required  Sponsor  Review Disclosure  Statements  in  accordance  with  HPD's  Sponsor  Review  policy.  Sponsor  Review Disclosure  Statements  are  also  required  to  be  completed  by  General  Contractors.    Sponsor Review will be performed at the time the applicant submits an original tax credit application. If a General Contractor has not been selected at the time the project submits its original tax credit  application,  Sponsor  Review  of  the  General  Contractor  will  be  performed  prior  to issuance of the carryover allocation.  Sponsor Review documents for the General Contractor should be submitted as soon as the Contractor is selected to avoid delays in the issuance of the carryover allocation.

11. Enterprise Green Communities and LEED Criteria - All substantial rehabs and new construction projects  will  be  required  to  certify  under  the  Enterprise  Green  Communities  Criteria Certification Overlay for NYC HPD projects or may choose to certify with LEED v4 Gold or Platinum via a waiver process. Details, instructions and criteria on submission protocol can be found on the HPD website at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-andinformation/enterprise-green-communities-criteria-egcc.page. As part of the tax credit application submission, applicants will be required to submit a Step 1 Pre-Build Approval from Enterprise  or  LEED  Waiver.    Additionally,  applicants  must  submit  proof  of  complete submission for Step 2:  Post Build Certification issued by Enterprise or LEED Certification prior to issuance of 8609s.  Rehabilitation projects containing all three of the following items in the project scope are required to certify under the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria Certification Overlay for NYC HPD projects (or may choose to certify with LEED v4 Gold or Platinum via a waiver process):
- Heating system replacement (includes heating equipment &amp; distribution system);
- Work on at least 75 percent of dwelling units including but not limited to fixture replacements ; and
- Substantial work on the building envelope, including  replacement or alteration of greater than or equal to at least 50 percent of the total glazing area or greater than or equal to at least 50 percent total opaque envelope

Projects unable to meet the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria Certification Overlay for NYC HPD projects, and qualify under an excluded category, may request a waiver. A waiver is also required for projects seeking to comply through LEED.  All LIHTC preservation projects receiving a waiver of the Green Communities Criteria Certification Overlay for NYC HPD must provide the required items and meet  the  mandatory  criteria  outlined  on  the  waiver  form  and  must  comply  with  HPD's  Standard Specifications. A copy of the waiver request form can be obtained at: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/services/Green-Communities-LEED-waiver.pdf. Note that all projects are required to complete a Solar Feasibility Analysis, as part of the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria certification process or as a required item for the waiver process.  Details for  the  Solar  Feasibility  Analysis  can  be  found  at  https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-andinformation/solar-where-feasible.page.

12. HPD Benchmarking Protocol - Applicants receiving allocations from HPD must comply with HPD's Benchmarking Protocol.  At application, applicants will be required to  acknowledge  and agree to follow  HPD's  Benchmarking  Protocol.    At  8609,  project  owners  will  be  required  to  submit  a notification that the benchmarking account has been set up with one of the pre-qualified benchmarking service  providers.    More  information  about  HPD's  Benchmarking  requirements  and  the  list  of prequalified providers can be found at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-andinformation/benchmarking-protocol.page
13. Income Averaging - Projects requesting to elect Income Averaging must submit the documentation along with their application (applicable to all 4% and 9% projects unless otherwise noted).  The required documentation can be found at:    https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/services/hpd-hdcincome-averaging-policy.pdf
14. Tenant Stability Plans - All applicants must describe property management practices and policies that will be implemented at the project and are intended to prevent or reduce evictions among the project's tenants. Such practices and policies may include, but are not limited to:
- Plans  for  proactively  addressing  rental  arrears  and/or  lease  violations  (e.g.,  payment  plans, mediation);
- Procedures for providing or making referrals to social services when tenants need assistance with rent payments or other needs; and
- Property  management  staff  dedicated  to  tenant  stability  and  eviction  prevention,  who  are responsible for identifying tenants at risk of eviction and implementing prevention policies.

If the applicant already engages in such practices and policies at other projects, the applicant should describe how such practices and policies have been used to successfully reduce evictions.

15. Equitable Ownership - Applicants must be MWBE-certified or demonstrate that their programming (such as training programs or job placement activities), staffing practices, and/or their use of MWBEcertified  subcontractors  or  partnering  programs  increases  the  participation  of  racial  and  ethnic minorities, women or local residents in the construction or management of affordable housing.  To pass threshold, all applicants that are not MWBE-certified must detail their current diversity and inclusion practices as well as provide a detailed track recording to support these practices.

Projects that do not meet the threshold criteria will not be reviewed further.  Applicants will be informed that the project is not eligible for a reservation of credits.  Applicants may reapply for subsequent funding cycles, but must pay an additional application fee.

## COMPETITIVE CRITERIA (9% PROJECTS ONLY)

A scoring system will be used to evaluate and rank those projects that meet the basic threshold criteria.  This system has been established to conform to the selection criteria contained in the Federal law as well as fulfill the objectives outlined in the Assessment of Housing Needs (Section V).  This scoring system has a maximum attainable  score  of  100  points,  including  special  priority  points  that  may  be  given  to  a  project  that  the Commissioner of HPD determines to be an important initiative or unique opportunity to meet basic local housing objectives.

HPD  will  establish  a  minimum  score  for  each  funding  round  based  on  the  scores  calculated  from  the applications.  The minimum score will be established by taking the average score and reducing it by 20%.  Any project scoring under 20% of the pipeline average will not be funded.

All elections made by the applicant on the original tax credit application will be included in the project's Regulatory  Agreement  and  will  remain  in  full  force  for  the  first  thirty  years  of  the  regulatory  term. Affordability restrictions will remain in full force for the duration of the Regulatory Agreement.  The elements for which competitive points will be awarded are:

## A.  PROJECT OCCUPANCY

- 6) Lower Costs (2) - Projects with an overall lower Total Development Cost (TDC) than projects of the same housing type (Supportive Housing, New Construction, and Preservation).  Projects will be ranked according to TDC within those housing types and the lower 50% of each category will receive points.
- 7) Social  Service  Commitment  (3)  -  Projects  with  committed  NYC  15/15  social  service  awards  or submitted application for apartments occupied by eligible households. Points will be awarded on a sliding scale.  The sliding scale is as follows:  projects that submit a 15/15 social service award letter

with the original tax credit application (3 points) or projects that have submitted a 15/15 social service application to HRA and have a proven track record of receiving 15/15 social service awards (1 points). A proven track record is defined as having been awarded at least one 15/15 social service award within the last 5 years.   To demonstrate this track record and receive points, the applicant must submit a 15/15 award letter dated within the last 5 years with the original tax credit application.

## C.  PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS

(Maximum points 25)

- 1) Concerted Community Revitalization Areas (6) - HPD allocates a preference to projects located in concerted community revitalization (CCR) areas.

4. (ii) at its discretion, without the consent of any Limited Partner, sell the project to the ROFR grantee in connection with the ROFR grantee's exercise of the ROFR following the General Partner's receipt of a bona fide third party offer to purchase the project; or
5. (iii)  offer  the  project  for  sale  publicly  at  any  time following the expiration of the tax credit compliance period and thereafter accept an offer from the highest bidder to purchase the project, as long as the sale price is not less than the minimum purchase price permissible under Section 42(i)(7)(B) of the Code, and provided that such acceptance is subject to the ROFR grantee's rights to exercise the ROFR and purchase the project at the ROFR Purchase Price;

c) authorize and direct the General Partner to execute all documents necessary to effect the sale of the project pursuant to the ROFR;

d) provide that, unless prohibited by binding legal precedent, the Limited Partners waive all legal rights to challenge (i) the sale of the project by the General Partner to the ROFR grantee even if the ROFR grantee is affiliated with the General Partner and (ii) the General Partner's acceptance of an offer from the highest bidder in response to the General Partner's public offer of the project for sale and/or the exercise of the ROFR by the ROFR grantee after any such acceptance;

- e) provide that the term of the ROFR shall expire not less than 36 months after the General Partner's public offer of the project for sale;
- f) provide that in the event that Section 42(i)(7) of the Code is amended to permit a qualified not-forprofit organization to hold a purchase option after the expiration of the tax credit compliance period, and only to the extent permitted under such revised Section 42(i)(7), the ROFR grantee shall be entitled to purchase the project, or at its option, all of the interests in the Owner, in either case at the ROFR Purchase Price, in lieu of exercising the ROFR;

h) prohibit, without the prior written consent of HPD, any amendment that would modify any term or condition related to the ROFR. A true and complete copy of the Agreement shall be provided to HPD as of both the closing of the financing for the construction of the project and the submission of an

application for a Form 8609, in each case for HPD's review to confirm that the Agreement includes the terms set forth in the letter of intent or terms that HPD determines are equivalent.

A true  and  complete  copy  of  the  operating  or  partnership  agreement  of  the  owner  of  the  project  shall  be provided to HPD as of both the closing of the financing for the construction of the project and the submission of an application for a Form 8609, in each case for HPD's review to confirm that such agreement includes the terms set forth in the letter of intent or terms that HPD determines are equivalent.

A fee-only arrangement for the MWBE or Qualified Nonprofit Organization will not satisfy this requirement.
- i) If the MWBE or Qualified Nonprofit Organization has at least 25% but less than 50% managing ownership interest - 2 points
6. ii) If  the  MWBE  or  Qualified  Nonprofit  Organization  has  at  least  50%  managing  ownership interest - 4 points

To receive points, the Applicant must submit verification of MWBE certification or the 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service as well as documentation to show the ownership interest percentage of each owner of the Applicant.

- 3) HPD  Development  History  and  Problems  -  Applicants  who  have  previously  received  tax  credit allocations or other development financing from HPD will be reviewed for outstanding problems on previous projects.  Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact HPD's Asset Management Division to confirm status of non-compliance and other issues.  Points will be deducted for applicants who are principals in any of the following:
- a) Projects with outstanding instances of uncorrected Tax Credit noncompliance.  (1 point deducted for each uncorrected finding, up to a maximum of 15 points)
- b) Projects with outstanding instances of uncorrected HOME noncompliance.  (1 point deducted for each uncorrected finding, up to a maximum of 15 points)
- c) Projects whose credit allocations have been returned to or recaptured by HPD.  (5 points deducted for any return or recapture of credits)
- d) Projects that are in default or workout status.  (10 points deducted for any such project)

## E.  PROJECT READINESS

(Maximum points 19)

- 1) Building  Plans  (10)-  Projects  that  have  submitted  construction  permit  documents  to,  or  received comments to submitted plans or received approval from, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) that indicate a construction start or an imminent start, as evidenced by printed documents from the DOB Buildings Information System (BIS) including the permit number, OR, adequate evidence of approval of construction documents by the construction lender, including HPD.  Points are awarded on a sliding scale.
- 2) Phase 1 Environmental Report (2) - Projects that can provide evidence the Phase 1 environmental report has been completed and submitted to HPD.
- 3) CEQR Final Determination (2) - Projects that can provide evidence that the project has completed CEQR in either the form of a Negative Declaration, Statement of Findings or Type II determination. Submitted Project documentation must match the project address or BBL description.
- 4) Design Review (5) - Projects that can submit documentation of HPD Building Land Development Services (BLDS) Design Approval or documentation that HPD BLDS has reviewed and approved the project for Expedited Review.

## F.  SPECIAL PRIORITY POINTS

(Maximum points 10)

Projects the Commissioner of HPD determines to be an important initiative or unique opportunity to meet the basic local housing objectives.

HPD will evaluate projects  according  to  their  strength  in  meeting  the  selection  criteria,  and  award  points accordingly.  The results of the evaluation will be determined by HPD in its sole discretion.  Any complete application which meets the eligibility review criteria but is not selected for a credit reservation will be placed on a waiting list to ensure a continuous flow of quality projects should additional credit authority become available before the next funding round. The waiting list will be terminated at the commencement of a new funding round.

## VII. PROJECT UNDERWRITING

The following guidelines apply equally to projects competing for an allocation of credits under HPD's Credit Authority and to 'as-of-right' credits for tax-exempt bond financed projects.  The determination of the amount of credit to be allocated to projects and the underwriting of projects will be made at each of the following times:

- 1) At Initial Review and Evaluation of the application for tax credits.
- 2) Prior to issuance of a Carryover Allocation of tax credits (not applicable to 'as-of-right' credits).
- 3) Prior to Certification of Allocation, i.e., when the project is placed in service.

A pre-requisite  for  underwriting  will  be  the  submission  of  the  rent  structure,  development  and  operating budgets, and financing and syndication plans.  (Applications, Carryover Allocation forms and Financial Update forms specifying the information required may be obtained from HPD.)

HPD will establish underwriting guidelines to ensure project feasibility and determine that credit allocated does not exceed the amount needed.  Section 42 requires that two forms of financial analysis be employed in determining the amount of the credit allocation:

- 1) Qualified Basis Analysis - Based on:
- a) Total qualified costs as adjusted, where allowable, for high cost areas.
- b) The "applicable fraction," the lower of low-income units or floor space.
- c) The monthly credit rate in effect; HPD will calculate the maximum credit amount for which the project could qualify.
- 2) Sources and Uses Analysis - HPD will compare total project costs (as adjusted to exclude the cost of Syndication Fees, Limited Partnership (or Upper Tier) Reserves, and Bridge Loan Fees and Interest) and total financing available to determine what, if any, gap in project financing exists.  The amount of credit needed to generate equity to fill the gap is then calculated.

The amount of credit allowable will be the lower of the two amounts calculated above.  (Actual allocation amounts may be lower than the amount allowable, depending on the availability of credit authority.)

The following guidelines will be employed in performing the financial analyses described above.

- 1) Development Costs - All development costs will be reviewed for reasonableness as required under Section 42.  As general reference points, HPD may refer to development cost guidelines used by the Agency's own financing programs or to general industry standards.  Costs may be reviewed both on a line-by-line basis, as well as on a total cost per unit basis.  HPD will consider reasonable variations in cost based on project location, scope of work involved, whether prevailing wage rules apply, and other factors.  The following specific guidelines will apply to all projects applying for tax credits:
- a) Eligible Basis - In performing the Qualified Basis Analysis for Rehab/Construction credits, HPD will  recognize  Eligible  Basis  in  amounts  not  exceeding  $300,000  per  residential  unit  for  9% projects.  For competitive 9% projects this maximum will apply the year the project first applies.
3. For 4% projects, the Eligible Basis cannot exceed $525,000 per residential unit for projects with a prevailing wage requirement and $675,000 per unit for all other projects.  For 'as-of-right' 4% bond  projects  this  maximum  will  apply  the  year  the  project  submits  a  'financial  update'  in anticipation of an IRS Form 8609.
4. However, the Commissioner of HPD has the right to waive the eligible  basis maximum if the applicant can demonstrate there is good cause to do so.  Waiver requests must be in writing and include documentation in support of the request.
- b) Cost Increases - At the 8609 stage of underwriting, HPD reserves the right to disallow costs that are not either: (a) identified in the initial application, or (b) based on unforeseen conditions.  For all projects, documentation and justification of any significant cost increases may be required.
- c) Acquisition  Costs  -  Acquisition  costs  exceeding  $500  per  unit  will  not  be  recognized  unless supported by a current independent appraisal of "as-is" value as it exists in the market today.  (HPD appraisals  are  also  acceptable.)    For  projects  with  acquisition  costs  in  excess  of  $20  million,

applicants must submit two independent appraisals.  For projects seeking acquisition credits, the appraisal date must be within one year prior to the date of acquisition and the credit rate in effect at the time the property was acquired will be used to calculate the acquisition credit.  If a project receives financing from an HPD loan program and the acquisition amount approved by the loan program  is  less  than  the  appraised  value,  only  the  cost  approved  by  the  loan  program  will  be recognized.    This  cap  applies  for  purposes  of  the  Qualified  Basis  Analysis,  the  Sources/Uses Analysis, and for calculating the allowable Developer Fee.  All appraisals must be on letterhead, executed, dated and marked final.

HPD may reduce any allowable costs where it finds there is an identity of interest among the parties to  the  sale,  such  as  common  financial  interests;  common  officers,  directors  or  stockholders;  or family relationships between officers, directors, or stockholders.

- d) Loan Interest - HPD may recognize in eligible basis interest on loans made by a limited partner to a project.  In such cases, documentation must be submitted that demonstrates the transaction is a bona fide loan that is repayable by a definite maturity date.   HPD may require an attorney's opinion that supports a finding that the transaction is a bona fide loan, and may also require documentation identifying the use of the loan proceeds and that the loan is financially necessary for the success of the project, as determined by HPD in its sole discretion.
- e) Developer Fees - The term 'Developer Fee' shall refer to and encompass all compensation for development  services,  including  all  staff  and  overhead  costs,  developer  profit,  and  the  cost  of consultants (financial, construction monitoring, relocation, and other consultants) engaged by the developer  to  perform  development  services.    If  the  construction  contract  price  includes  any consulting  fees,  this  must  be  disclosed  at  the  time  of  application  and  at  the  time  the  8609  is submitted.    In  performing  the  Qualified  Basis  Analysis  and  Sources/Uses  Analysis,  HPD  will recognize  Developer  Fees  in  amounts  not  exceeding  15%  of  improvement  costs  and  10%  of acquisition costs.  For this purpose 'improvement costs' excludes Developer Fee, reserves and syndication and partnership expenses.
- f) Deferred Developer Fees - HPD will recognize deferred Developer Fees in the Qualified Basis and Sources and Uses analyses only when all the following conditions are met:
- i) Total  Developer  Fee,  including  any  deferred  portions,  does  not  exceed  the  15%  standard described above,
5. ii) the owner's liability for such fees is incurred under a valid development agreement and reflected in the partnership documents, and
6. iii) the applicant can demonstrate in a manner acceptable to HPD that a clear source of revenue exists, usually cash flow, to enable the deferred fees to be paid within 15 years of the expected placed in service date of the project.
- g) 'Waived' Developer Fees - In calculating the credit amount, HPD will recognize Developer Fees only if they are:
- i) Included in the application's development budget, and
9. ii) reflected as a non-contingent liability in the partnership documents.  These requirements will apply whether or not such Developer Fees are included in Eligible Basis, and whether or not

the developer may subsequently waive the fee.

- h) Disclosure of Upper Tier Partnership and/or Any Other Fees - Applicants must disclose any fees paid at the upper tier partnership level and/or any other fees paid to any parties to the transactions involving the syndication, development and/or operation of the project.  Projects will be evaluated to determine if the fees are reasonable and necessary.  HPD may adjust credit allocations by an amount equal to any fees that HPD finds to be excessive or unnecessary.
- i) Reserves - Projects will be evaluated to determine that operating reserves are adequate (but not excessive) to insure project affordability and viability over the project term.  'Standalone' projects must have replacement reserves equal to at least $300 per unit per year.  Operating reserves for 'standalone'  projects  must  equal  at  least  6  months  operating  expenses,  debt  service  and replacement reserve payments.  Additional amounts necessary to provide operating assistance to support very low income, homeless and special needs populations may be permitted.  All reserves, whether funded from the Developer Fee or separately, must be irrevocably committed to the project. For purposes of analyzing reserves, HPD may review a project's income and expense data and cash flow analyses, as it deems necessary, and may require justification for reserves required by lenders or investors.  Reserve amounts considered by HPD to be excessive may be reduced for purposes of performing the Sources/Uses analysis.
- j) Identity of Interest - Identity of Interest shall mean any financial, familial or business ownership relationship between any general partner and any participant in the project's development.  This includes, but is not limited to, existence of a reimbursement arrangement or exchange of funds; common financial interests; common officers, directors or stockholders; or family relationships between officers, directors, or stockholders.
4. HPD may reduce any allowable costs where an Identity of Interest has been found among the parties to the transactions involving the syndication, development, and/or operation of the project.  All applicants will be required to submit an affidavit disclosing the nature of any identity of interest. Where an identity of interest exists among parties to the sale, development, and/or operation of the project,  the  applicant  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  expenditures  to  be  customary  given  the financial structure of the project.  HPD may also request that the applicant provide information regarding  all  officers,  directors  and  principal  shareholders  of  the  development  and  contracting organizations and their relationship to the project and each other.
- k) Community Service Facility - The allowable basis for community service facilities located in a HUD-defined Qualified Census Tract ('QCT') is 25% of the first $15 million of eligible basis and 10% of additional basis.  If a project is not located in a HUD-defined QCT, the community service facility costs are not allowable in eligible basis.
- l) 30% Basis Boost -   The Code provides that all projects located in a HUD-defined QCT or in a Difficult  Development  Area  (DDA)  are  eligible  for  up  to  a  30%  increase  in  basis.   HUD  has designated only certain zip codes in New York City as a DDA.  However, the Code also allows allocating agencies to designate areas within their jurisdiction as DDA's. HPD has designated all five boroughs in New York City as a DDA.    Therefore, all 9% projects in New York City will be eligible for the basis boost.   (4% projects are only eligible for the basis boost if they are located in a HUD-defined QCT or DDA.)
- 2) Financing  -  All  sources  of  financing  will  be  examined.    All  developments  must  demonstrate  that sufficient sources are available to the project to assure feasibility.  Evidence of commitment must be

provided for all debt financing, including specific amounts and terms of repayment.  HPD reserves the right to review debt service coverage ratios, to calculate the amount of debt the project could support, and  to  use  such  imputed  debt  amounts  in  its  Sources  and  Uses  Analysis,  if  it  deems  appropriate. 'Standalone' projects must demonstrate a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.15, and positive cash flow over 15 year period.

At the Carryover Allocation stage all financing commitments must be firm.  Evidence of commitment must confirm the amounts and terms of financing stated in the application.

In accordance with Section 42, all final executed and recorded legal and loan documents, including final permanent loan documents, supporting the information represented in the Financial Update must be submitted prior to issuance of the 8609.  For 4% projects with permanent financing issued through New York City Housing Development Corporation (HDC), a letter from  HDC must be submitted confirming the permanent loan amount if the mortgage is not being modified at the permanent loan conversion.  All projects must convert to permanent financing prior to submitting for 8609 to ensure all costs and financing are final.

For related party and unconventional loans, the following must be submitted:

The Lender must represent in writing that (i) the note is negotiable, repayable, and, if not secured by a mortgage, recourse, (ii) it intends to take the necessary actions as a reasonably prudent lender would take to enforce its rights under the note to collect payment of the debt, (iii) it will treat the loan as an asset in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles.

The Borrower must represent in writing that (i) the note is negotiable, repayable, and, if not secured by a mortgage, recourse, (ii) it intends to repay the loan in accordance with the terms of the note, (iii) there are no formal or informal understandings or arrangements with the lender that the will be forgiven, and (iv) it will not request the lender to forgive the loan in the future.

Additionally, HPD may require an attorney's opinion that supports a finding that the transaction is a bona fide loan,and may also require documentation identifying the use of the loan proceeds and that the  loan  is  financially  necessary  for  the  success  of  the  project,  as  determined  by  HPD  in  its  sole discretion.

- 3) Syndication Proceeds - In calculating the amount of credit required to fill any financing gap identified in the Sources and Uses Analysis, HPD will use an assumed minimum net equity raise factor, which shall be determined by the agency yearly, based on the agency's evaluation of current market trends. This raise factor will be applied as follows:
- a) Timing of Analysis - The assumed minimum raise factor will be used for analyses conducted at the initial application and Carryover Allocation stages, unless the applicant has provided documentation of the actual raise factor pledged by the investor.  If the actual raise factor is known, HPD will utilize the higher of the actual or the assumed minimum.  At the "8609" stage, applicants must provide documentation of actual gross and net equity.  At this stage, HPD will utilize the higher of the actual raise factor or the assumed minimum factor in effect when the credits were first reserved or allocated.
- b) Source of Equity - If tax credit equity is being raised through syndication, the assumed minimum raise factor (as expressed in cents on the dollar) will apply.  If equity is raised through a private placement with a single investor, or if the general partner or the owner is utilizing tax credits, the

assumed minimum will be increased.  Where an identity of interest exists between the developer and/or investor, the equity source will be treated as a private placement.

- 4) Operating Costs - The rents and operating budget will be reviewed for reasonableness.  As general reference  points,  HPD  may  refer  to  operating  cost  guidelines  used  by  the  agency's  own  financing programs, or to general industry standards.  HPD may establish reasonable assumptions with respect to the rates at which income and expenses can be expected to increase.
- 5) HOME Subsidy Layering - When Federal HOME funds are to be used with tax credits, HPD will perform a subsidy layering review to determine that the level of assistance is appropriate and that the project owner will not receive excessive compensation or excessive Federal subsidy through HPD. Under current regulations, where Federal funds other than HOME are used in conjunction with tax credits, HUD performs the subsidy layering review.
- 6) Tenant-Based Section 8 Vouchers - 'standalone' projects anticipating availability of new tenant-based Section 8 vouchers must be underwritten at rents not greater than the maximum tax credit rents.
- 7) Outstanding Charges or Liens - 'standalone' projects must not have any outstanding real estate tax, water or sewer charges or liens.
- 8) Rent Rolls - rehabilitation projects must submit current rent roll with original tax credit application.
- 9) Capital  Needs  Assessment  -  'standalone'  rehabilitation  projects  must  submit  a  Capital  Needs Assessment to show adequate capital needs.
- 10) Minimum Set Aside Election - Each project must elect one of the following Minimum Set Aside Elections:
8. (a) 25/60 Election:  At least 25% of all residential rental units must be set aside for households at or below 60% of Area Median Income.
9. (b) 20/50 Election:  At least 20% of all residential rental units must be set aside for households at or below 50% of Area Median Income.  Please note that if the 20/50 election is selected, only units at or below 50% can be designated as tax credits units.  Any unit above 50% will be treated as non-tax credit and treated as such in the applicable fraction calculation.
10. (c) Income Averaging Election:  At least 25 % of all residential rental units must be set aside for households whose incomes do not exceed the imputed income limitation designated by the taxpayer.  The average of the imputed income limitations designated cannot exceed 60 percent  of  AMI.    The  designated  imputed  income  limitations  must  be  in  10  percent increments as follows: 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80%.  More on HPD/HDC's policy regarding Income Averaging can be found here: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/services/hpd-hdc-income-averagingpolicy.pdf

HPD's underwriting and subsequent allocation of credit shall not be construed as a representation or warranty of feasibility or viability of a project.

## VIII. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR EXTENDED USE PERIOD

One of the mechanisms by which HPD will discharge its post allocation responsibilities is through enforcement of a regulatory agreement executed with the project owner.  (See also Section IX - Compliance Monitoring.) It  is  required that the regulatory agreement be recorded as a restrictive covenant prior to the issuance of a Certification of Allocation (IRS form 8609) or Carryover Allocation document.  In addition, the essential terms of the regulatory agreement as it affects low-income tenants shall be contained in a rider attached to the lease of each low-income unit.  The regulatory agreement will specify the following for the low income portion of the building(s):

- 1) The agreement shall be binding on all successors of the owner;
- 2) The project is subject to the requirements of Section 42;
- 3) The owner shall agree to attach a lease rider to the lease of each low-income unit on forms provided by HPD that will disclose the restricted rent for such unit;
- 4) The lease rider which the owner must attach to the lease of each low-income unit will require the tenant to annually provide income verifications to the owner;
- 5) The  owner  shall  agree  under  the  regulatory  agreement  that  the  applicable  fraction  (as  defined  in subsection (c) (1) of Section 42) for the building for each taxable year in the extended use period will not be less than the applicable fraction for the building when placed in service;
- 6) The owner shall consent to enforcement in any State court of the extended use requirement by any prospective, present or former income eligible persons;
- 7) The owner shall annually submit to HPD a certification that the building is owned and operated in compliance with the provisions of Section 42 and any regulations promulgated thereunder;
- 8) The owner shall not retaliate against any tenant who notifies HPD of alleged violations of the regulatory agreement.

HPD is responsible for enforcing all regulatory agreements and reporting non-compliance.  All correspondence and/or legal notices relating to the regulatory agreement should be addressed to HPD.

## IX. COMPLIANCE MONITORING

As a Housing Credit Agency, HPD is required to monitor compliance with Low Income Housing Tax Credit ('LIHTC')  requirements  of  Section  42  for  all  projects  awarded  credits  by  HPD.    HPD  may  delegate  its monitoring  responsibility  in  the  case  of  tax-exempt  bond  financed  projects.    The  agency's  monitoring obligations include:  a) monitoring record keeping and record retention by project owners; b) receiving and reviewing annual owner certifications; c) making periodic on-site inspections of projects and records; and d) notifying the IRS of non-compliance.  The specific IRS requirements provide that HPD monitor the following:

## RECORD KEEPING AND RETENTION

- 1) Record keeping - The owner of a LIHTC project shall keep records for each qualified low income building in the project and make these records available to HPD upon request.  These records shall show for each year in the compliance period the following:

- a) Total number of residential rental units in each building, including the number of bedrooms and size in square feet of each residential rental unit.
- b) The percentage and location of LIHTC qualified low income residential units in each building.
- c) The rent charges for each residential rental unit, including any utility allowances.
- d) The number of occupants in each LIHTC qualified unit, but only if rent is determined by the number of occupants in each unit under Internal Revenue Code Section 42(g)(2) (as in effect before the amendments made by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989).
- e) For each building with LIHTC qualified low-income units, all vacancies that occurred in LIHTC units and information that shows when, and to whom, the next available units were rented.
- f) All annual income certifications submitted by each past and present tenant of LIHTC qualified low income units.
- g) The documentation to support certifications (for example, a copy of the tenant's federal income tax return  or  W-2  Forms  or  verification  of  income  from  third  parties  such  as  employers  or  state agencies) that tenant income is calculated in a manner consistent with the determination of annual income under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 ("Section 8').
- h) The eligible basis and qualified basis of the building at the end of the first year of the credit period (i.e., the first IRS Form 8609 filed with the IRS for each building).
- i) A description of the character and use of the non-residential portion of each building if included in the  building's  eligible  basis  under  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  42(d)  (for  example,  tenant facilities that are available on a comparable basis to all tenants and for which no separate fee is charged for use of the facilities reasonably related to the project).
- j) Management agreements, all tenant waiting lists, leases, riders, HCR rent registration, complaints, tenant correspondence and related records.
- k) Original local health, safety, or building code violation reports or notices that were issued by the State or local government unit responsible for making such inspections.
- 2) Record Retention - The owner of a LIHTC project shall retain the above records for each building in the project for at least six years beyond the end of the 30-year extended use period for the building.

## ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

Process - Annual certifications shall be submitted for all projects for which an IRS form 8609 has been issued, and shall be submitted annually for the 30-year period during which the project is subject to regulation under Section 42.  The owner of a LIHTC housing project shall certify annually under the penalty of perjury that the project or building is in compliance with all state and federal applicable laws, regulations, procedures, policies and contractual obligations in a form approved by HPD ("Owner Certification").

Requirements - The owner certification shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the following:

- 1) Part A:  Project and ownership data.
- 2) Part B:  Certification that:
- a) The project meets the requirements of:
- i) the 20-50 test under Section 42(g)(1)(A), or the 25-60 test under Sections 42(g)(4) and 142(d)(6) for New York City, whichever minimum set aside test is applicable to the project; and
5. ii) if applicable to the project, the 15-40 test under Sections 42(g)(4) and 142(d)(4)(B) for "deep rent skewed" projects;
- b) The  owner  has  received  an  annual  income  certification  from  each  tenant  residing  in  a  LIHTC qualified low income unit and documentation to support that certification;
- c) Each LIHTC qualified low income unit in the project is rent restricted under Section 42(g)(2);
- d) All LIHTC qualified low income units in the project were for use by the general public, and there has  been  no  finding  of  discrimination  under  the  Fair  Housing  Act  (including  an  adverse  final decision by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), an adverse final decision by a state or local fair housing agency, or an adverse judgment from a federal court.)
- e) All LIHTC qualified low income units in the project are used on a non-transient basis (except for transitional  housing  for  the  homeless  provided  under  Section  42(i)(3)(B)(iii)  or  single-room occupancy units rented on a month-by-month basis under Section 42(I)(3) (B)(iv);
- f) Each building in the project is suitable for occupancy, taking into account local health, safety, and building codes, and no State or local government unit responsible for making local health, safety, or building code inspections issued a violation report for any building or unit in the project. (If a violation  report  or  notice  was  issued  during  the  calendar  year  covered  by  the  certification,  a summary of such violations(s) must be included with the certification, and the owner must state whether the violation has been corrected;
- g) There has been no change in the eligible basis (as defined in Section 42(d)) of any building in the project; or if there has been such a change(s) the owner shall certify to the nature of the change(s) on a building by building basis;
- h) There has been no change in the applicable fraction (as defined in Section 42(c)(1)(B)) of any building in the project; if there has been such change(s) the owner shall certify to the nature of the change(s) on a building by building basis;
- i) All tenant facilities included in the eligible basis under Section 42(d) of any building in the project, such  as  swimming  pools,  other  recreational  facilities,  and  parking  areas  are  provided  on  a comparable basis without charge to all tenants in the building;
- j) If a LIHTC qualified low income unit in the project became vacant, reasonable attempts were, are being, or will be made to rent that unit or the next available unit of comparable or smaller size to tenants having a qualifying income before any units in the project were or will be rented to tenants not having a qualifying income;
- k) If the income of tenants of a LIHTC qualified low income unit in the project increased above the limit allowed in Section 42(g)(2)(D)(ii), the next available unit of comparable or smaller size in the

project was rented to tenants having a qualifying income, unless the project qualified for "deep rent skewing";

- l) An extended low income housing commitment (regulatory agreement) as  described  in  Internal Revenue Code Section 42(h)(6) was in effect (for buildings subject to Section 7108(c)(1) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989), including the requirement under section 42(h)(6)(B)(iv) that an owner cannot refuse to lease a unit in the project to an applicant because the applicant holds a voucher or certificate of eligibility under Section 8 of the US Housing Act of 1937; and
- m) The project has been operated in compliance with the HPD regulatory agreement (if applicable).

## Additional Tenant Data Collection

HUD now requires based on Section 2835(d) of the Housing and Economic Reform Act of 2008, that each  State  agency  administering  tax  credits  under  section  42  (low-income  housing  tax  credits  or LIHTC) to furnish HUD, not less than annually, information concerning the race, ethnicity, family composition, age, income, use of Section 8 rental assistance or other similar assistance, disability status, and monthly rental payments of households residing in each property receiving such credits through such agency.

Accordingly,  owners  must  provide  the  additional  information  as  part  of  the  annual  certification submission on a revised tenant income certification, or through other forms or processes as HPD may require.

## COMPLIANCE REVIEW

- 1) Review of Owner Certifications - HPD shall review the owner certifications for compliance with the requirements of Section 42.
- 2) Inspections - HPD shall inspect all new LIHTC projects during the first year they are in compliance monitoring.  Subsequently, projects will be inspected at three-year intervals (five-year intervals during the  'extended  use  period').    At  HPD's  discretion,  inspections  may  be  conducted  at  more  frequent intervals.    During  inspections,  at  least  20%  of  apartments  will  be  inspected.    Inspections  will  be conducted according to HUD's Housing Quality Standards ('HQS').  HPD shall provide reasonable advance notice to the owner that an inspection will occur.  Such inspections may include, but are not limited to:
- a) A physical inspection of the building, grounds, individual rental units, common facilities and central systems for general construction.
- b) Interviews of tenants and project employees.
- c) Review of all records described in 'Record keeping' above.
- 3) Review of Records - As part of its onsite inspections, HPD will inspect records of selected LIHTC qualified low income units (in accordance with IRS regulations) in all new LIHTC projects during the first year the projects are in compliance monitoring.  Subsequently, project records will be inspected at three-year  intervals  (five-year  intervals  during  the  'extended  use  period').    At  HPD's  discretion, inspections may be conducted at more frequent intervals.  HPD will choose which tenants' records to inspect in such a manner that the owner will not know in advance which units are to be inspected.

Those records which must be inspected may include, but will not necessarily be limited to:

- a) The tenant's initial income certification demonstrating his/her qualification as a low-income tenant at move-in, together with income documentation the owner received to support this certification;
- b) Annual tenant income re-certifications, together with income documentation the owner has received to support these certifications (an exception applies for owners of projects in which 100% of the residential units are LIHTC qualified low income units, as discussed in the following section);
- c) Rent Records;
- d) Review of all records described in 'Record keeping' above.

## WAIVER OF ANNUAL TENANT INCOME RECERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT

- 1) Under  section  142(d)(3)(A)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  the  annual  income  re-certification requirement is not applicable for projects in which 100% of the residential rental units are LIHTC qualified low-income units.  Projects in which 100% of the residential units are LIHTC qualified lowincome units may discontinue annual income re-certification after having completed the initial annual income certification for all units.
- 2) Irrespective of section 142(d)(3)(A), all projects are still subject to all other regulatory requirements including the obligation to submit annual owner certifications.  In addition, HPD reserves the right, at its  discretion,  to  continue  requiring  annual  income  re-certifications,  or  to  reinstate  annual  recertification requirements, in certain instances.  These may include, but not be limited to, projects found by HPD to have less than 100% low-income occupancy, or to have noncompliance with any other IRS requirements.

## RIGHT TO INSPECT

In addition to the inspections described above, HPD shall have the right to perform an on-site inspection of any LIHTC project at least through the end of the compliance period and the extended use period.

## NOTIFICATION OF NON-COMPLIANCE

- 1) General - In accordance with Federal law HPD shall notify project owners and the Internal Revenue Service of non-compliance with any requirement or of any failure to submit the owner certification as required by Section 42(m)(1)(B)(iii).
- 2) Specific Requirements - HPD notification provisions are as follows:
- a) Notice to Owner - HPD shall provide prompt written notice to the owner of discovery upon inspection,  review,  or  in  some  other  manner,  that  the  project  is  not  in  compliance  with  the provisions of Section 42;
- b) Notice  to  Internal  Revenue  Service  -  Upon  finding  any  failure  to  certify  or  other  event  of noncompliance as described above, HPD shall file Form 8823, "Low Income Housing Credit Agencies Report of Noncompliance", and/or provide such other notification as is required by Section 42, with the Internal Revenue Service. Such notification will be filed no later than 45 days after the end of the correction period (as described in Paragraph 3 of this section), whether or not the noncompliance or failure to certify has been certified.  If HPD reports on Form 8823 that a building has gone entirely out of compliance and will not be in compliance at any time in the  future,  HPD  need  not  file  Form  8823  in  subsequent  years  to  report  that  building's

- noncompliance.
- c) Correction Period - HPD may, at its discretion, allow the owner a period of time to correct a failure to certify or any other event(s) of non-compliance ("correction period").  The correction period shall not exceed 90 days from the date HPD sends the notice described in paragraph 1 of this  Section.    HPD  may  extend  the  correction  period  for  up  to  180  days,  if  HPD,  in  its  sole discretion, determines there is good cause for granting the extension.

## DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY

HPD, at its  discretion,  may  retain  an  agent  or  other  private  contractor  to  perform  compliance  monitoring functions and activities, or may delegate all or some of its monitoring responsibilities for a project to another Housing Credit Agency within the State of New York, to the extent such delegation is allowed by law.

## LIABILITY

Compliance with the requirements of Section 42 is the sole responsibility of the owner of the building for which the credit is allowable.  HPD's obligation to monitor for compliance with the requirements of Section 42 shall not make HPD liable in any way whatsoever for an owner's non-compliance.
