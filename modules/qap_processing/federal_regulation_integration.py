        26 USC 42: Low-income housing credit
        
        (a) In general
        For purposes of section 38, the amount of the low-income housing credit determined under this section for any taxable year in the credit period shall be an amount equal to—

        (b) Applicable percentage: 70 percent and 30 percent credits
        (1) Determination of applicable percentage
        For purposes of this section—
        (A) In the case of any building which is placed in service by the taxpayer after 1987, the applicable percentage is—
        (i) the 70 percent present value credit for any building—
        (I) which is a new building, or
        (II) which is an existing building, but only if such building is substantially rehabilitated.
        (ii) the 30 percent present value credit for any building not described in clause (i).
        
        (c) Qualified basis; qualified low-income building
        For purposes of this section—
        (1) Qualified basis
        (A) Determination
        The qualified basis of any qualified low-income building for any taxable year is an amount equal to—
        (i) the applicable fraction (determined as of the close of such taxable year) of
        (ii) the eligible basis of such building (determined under subsection (d)(1)).
        
        (d) Eligible basis
        For purposes of this section—
        (1) New buildings
        The eligible basis of a new building is its adjusted basis as of the close of the first taxable year of the credit period.
        
        (e) Rehabilitation expenditures treated as separate new building
        (1) In general
        Rehabilitation expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer with respect to any building shall be treated for purposes of this section as a separate new building.
        
        (f) Definition and special rules relating to credit period
        (1) Credit period defined
        For purposes of this section, the term 'credit period' means, with respect to any building, the period of 10 taxable years beginning with—
        (A) the taxable year in which the building is placed in service, or
        (B) at the election of the taxpayer, the succeeding taxable year.
        
        (g) Qualified low-income housing project
        For purposes of this section—
        (1) In general
        The term 'qualified low-income housing project' means any project for residential rental property if such project meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) whichever is elected by the taxpayer:
        (A) 20-50 test
        The project meets the requirements of this subparagraph if 20 percent or more of the residential rental units in such project are both rent-restricted and occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of area median gross income.
        
        (h) Application of at-risk rules
        The credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any building shall be determined by taking into account only the qualified basis of such building to the extent the taxpayer is at risk (within the meaning of section 465) with respect to such qualified basis.
        
        (i) Definitions and special rules
        For purposes of this section—
        (1) Compliance period
        The term 'compliance period' means, with respect to any building, the period of 15 taxable years beginning with the first taxable year of the credit period with respect to such building.
        
        (j) Recapture of credit
        (1) In general
        If—
        (A) as of the close of any taxable year in the compliance period, the amount of the qualified basis of any building with respect to the taxpayer is less than
        (B) the amount of such basis as of the close of the preceding taxable year,
        then the taxpayer's tax under this chapter for the taxable year shall be increased by the credit recapture amount.
        
        (k) Application to partnerships and S corporations
        In the case of any partnership or S corporation which owns a qualified low-income housing project—
        (1) the determination of whether such partnership or S corporation meets the requirements of this section shall be made at the partnership or S corporation level, and
        (2) any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to such project shall be allocated among the partners of such partnership or the shareholders of such S corporation in accordance with their respective interests in such partnership or S corporation.
        
        (l) Certifications and other requirements
        (1) Certification required
        No credit shall be allowed under subsection (a) with respect to any building for the taxable year unless such building is certified by the housing credit agency to be in compliance with the requirements of this section.
        
        (m) Responsibility of housing credit agencies
        (1) Plans for allocation of credit among projects
        (A) In general
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the housing credit dollar amount with respect to any building shall be zero unless—
        (i) such building is located in a qualified census tract or the development of which contributes to a concerted community revitalization plan, and
        (ii) if such building is placed in service during the period described in subparagraph (B)(ii), the housing credit agency allocates a housing credit dollar amount to such building pursuant to a qualified allocation plan of such agency.
