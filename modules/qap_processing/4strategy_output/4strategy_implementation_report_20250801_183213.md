IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
=========================
1. CRITICAL SECTIONS RECOVERY:
   - Minimum construction standards (comprehensive sections, not fragments)
   - Scoring criteria (complete point allocations)  
   - Application procedures (complete requirements)
   - Compliance monitoring (complete oversight)

2. QUALITY VALIDATION:
   - ≥95% content completeness per jurisdiction
   - Expert validation against professional market studies
   - "Minimum construction standards" test passing
   - Cross-reference integrity maintained

3. SYSTEM RELIABILITY:
   - Docling pipeline optimization (96% PDF coverage achieved)
   - Multi-agent quality gates (STRIKE_LEADER → WINGMAN → TOWER)
   - Real-time completeness monitoring
   - Professional deployment readiness
