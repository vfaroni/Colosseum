These regulations shall take precedence with respect to any and all conflicts with provisions of the QAP or other guidance provided by the Committee.  This subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of the QAP and other guidance in cases where said documents seek to fulfill, without conflict, the requirements of federal and state statutes pertaining to the Tax Credit Programs.\n- (g) The Committee may, at its sole discretion, reject an application if the proposed project fails to meet the minimum point requirements established by the Committee prior to that funding round.

Set-asides and Apportionments.\n\nCTCAC will accept applications from Qualified Nonprofit Organizations for the Nonprofit set-aside upon the request of the qualified applicant, regardless of the proposed housing type.  Thereafter, CTCAC shall review each non-rural pending competitive application applying as an at-risk or special needs housing type under  subsection  (h)  below,  first,  within  that  housing  type's  relevant  set-aside.  Non-rural  applicants meeting the criteria for both the special needs and at-risk housing types pursuant to Section 10325(g) may request to be considered in both set-asides.  Applicants receiving an award from either the At-Risk or Special Needs set-aside shall be considered as that housing type for purposes of paragraph (h).\n\n- (a) Nonprofit  Set-Aside.    Ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  Federal  Credit  Ceiling  for  any  calendar  year, calculated as of February first of the calendar year, shall be set-aside for projects involving, over the entire restricted use period, Qualified Nonprofit Organizations as the only general partners and developers, as defined by these regulations, and in accordance with IRC Section (42)(h)(5).\n- (b) Nonprofit Set-Aside Homeless Assistance Project Priority.\n- (1) Each  funding  round,  credits  available  in  the  Nonprofit  set-aside  shall  be  prioritized  for qualified Homeless assistance , meaning the greater of 15 Low-Income Units or twenty-five percent  (25%)  of  the  Low-Income  Units  within  the  project  are  designated  for  people experiencing Homelessness and the average targeted income for those units is no more than forty percent (40%) AMI, in the following priority order:\n- (A) Qualified Homeless  assistance projects with 1) McKinney-Vento  Homeless Assistance Act, HCD Multifamily Housing Program (MHP), HCD Veterans Housing and  Homeless  Prevention  Program  (VHHP),  HCD  Homekey,  Mental  Health Services Act (MHSA), CalHFA Local Government Special Needs Housing Program, Governor's Homeless Initiative, Housing for a Healthy California, or HCD No Place Like Home development capital funding committed of at least $500,000 or $10,000 per unit for all Low-Income Units in the project, whichever is greater; or 2) projects with rental or operating assistance funding commitments from federal, state, or local governments where the rental assistance is sponsor-based or project-based and the remaining term of any project-based assistance contract is no less than one (1) year and  applies  to  no  less  than  fifty  percent  (50%)  of  the  Low-Income  Units  in  the proposed project.  For local government funding sources, ongoing assistance may be in the form of a letter of intent from the governmental entity.\n- (B) Second priority will be given to other qualified Homeless assistance projects.\n- (2) For all projects receiving a reservation under (b)(1)(A) or (B), owners, property managers, and service  providers  shall  comply  with  the  core  components  of  Housing  First  and  the tenant selection requirements of Section 10336(b)(2)(B)(ii).\n- (c) Rural  set-aside.    Twenty  percent  (20%)  of  the  Federal  Credit  Ceiling  for  any  calendar  year, calculated as of February first of the calendar year, shall be set-aside for projects in rural areas as defined in H &amp; S Code Section 50199.21 and as identified in supplemental application material prepared by CTCAC.  For purposes of implementing Section 50199.21(a), an area is eligible under the Section 515 program on January 1 of the calendar year in question if it either resides on the\n\nSection 515 designated places list in effect the prior September 30, or is so designated in writing by the USDA Multifamily Housing Program Director.  All Projects located in eligible census tracts defined by this Section must compete in the rural set-aside and will not be eligible to compete in other set-asides or in the geographic areas unless the Geographic Region in which they are located has had no other Eligible Projects for reservation within the current calendar year.  In such cases the rural project may receive a reservation in the last round for the year, from the geographic region in which it is located, if any.\n\nWithin the rural set-aside competition, the first tiebreaker shall be applied as described in Section 10325(c)(9), except that the Seniors, Large Family New Construction in Highest or High Resource Tract, and Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation housing type goals established by Section 10315(h) shall be calculated relative to the rural set-aside dollars available each round, rather than against the total credits available statewide each round.\n\n- (1) RHS, HOME, and CDBG-DR program apportionment.  In each reservation cycle, fourteen percent (14%) of the rural set-aside shall be available for new construction projects which have a funding commitment from RHS of at least $1,000,000 from either RHS's Section 514 Farm  Labor  Housing  Loan  Program,  RHS's  Section  515  Rural  Rental  Housing  Loan Program, or a reservation from a Participating Jurisdiction or the State of California of at least $1,000,000 in HOME or CDBG-DR funding.\n2. All  projects  meeting  the  RHS,  HOME,  and  CDBG-DR  program  apportionment  eligibility requirements shall compete under the RHS, HOME, and CDBG-DR program apportionment.  Projects that are unsuccessful under the apportionment shall then compete within the general rural set-aside described in subsection (c).  Any amount reserved under this subsection for which RHS, HOME, or CDBG-DR funding does not become available in the calendar year in which the reservation is made, or any amount of Credit apportioned by this  subsection  and  not  reserved  during  a  reservation  cycle  shall  be  available  for applications qualified under the Rural set-aside.\n- (2) Native American apportionment.  In each reservation cycle starting in 2024 and each year thereafter,  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  rural  set-aside  shall  be  available  for  applications proposing projects on land to be owned by a Tribe, whether the land is owned in fee or in trust, and in which occupancy will be legally limited to tribal households, except that up to 20%  of  Low-Income  Units  may  serve  non-tribal  households  if  required  by  the  HOME Program. Apportioned dollars shall be awarded to projects sponsored by Tribes using the scoring  criteria  in  Section  10325(c),  and  achieving  the  minimum  score  established  by CTCAC under Section 10305(h).  In addition, the application shall receive the minimum points  available  for  both  general  partner  and  management  company  experience  under Section 10325(c)(1), except that the management company minimum scoring cannot be obtained through the point category for a housing tax credit certification examination.\n4. (d) 'At-Risk' set-aside. After accounting for the second supplemental set-aside described in (g), five percent (5%) of the Federal Credit Ceiling for any calendar year, calculated as of February first of the calendar year, shall be set aside for projects that qualify and apply as an 'At risk' housing type pursuant  to  subsection  (h)  below.  Any  proposed  project  that  applies  and  is  eligible  under  the Nonprofit set-aside but is not awarded credits from that set-aside shall be eligible to be considered under  this  At-Risk  set-aside  if  the  project  meets  the  housing  type  requirements  in  Section 10325(g)(4).\n5. (e) Special Needs set-aside. After accounting for the second supplemental set-aside described in (g), four percent (4%) of the Federal Credit Ceiling for any calendar year, calculated as of February first of the calendar year, shall be set aside for projects that qualify and apply as Special Needs.  Any proposed Special Needs project that applies and is eligible under the Nonprofit set-aside, but is not awarded credits from that set-aside, shall be eligible to be considered under this Special Needs set-aside.\n\n- (f) First supplemental set-aside.  After accounting for the second supplemental set-aside described in (g), an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the Federal Credit Ceiling for any calendar year, calculated as of February first of the calendar year, shall be held back to fund overages that occur in  the  second  funding  round  set-asides  and/or  in  the  Geographic  Apportionments  because  of funding  projects  in  excess  of  the  amounts  available  to  those  Set  Asides  or  Geographic Apportionments, the funding of large projects, such as HOPE VI projects, or other Waiting List or priority projects. In addition to this initial funding, returned Tax Credits and unused Tax Credits from Set Asides and Geographic Apportionments will be added to this Supplemental Set Aside, and used to fund projects at year end so as to avoid loss of access to National Pool credits.\n- (g) Second supplemental set-aside.  For each calendar year an amount of the Federal Credit Ceiling determined by the Executive Director, calculated as of February first of the calendar year, shall be held back to fund projects designated as DDA project pursuant to Section 10327(d)(3).\n- (h) Housing types.  To be eligible for Tax Credits, all applicants must select and compete in only one of the categories listed below, exclusive of the Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation and Large Family New Construction located in a Highest or High Resource Area housing types which are listed here solely  for  purposes  of  the  tiebreaker  in  Section  10325(c)(9),  and  must  meet  the  applicable 'additional  threshold  requirements'  of  Section  10325(g),  in  addition  to  the  Basic  Threshold Requirements in 10325(f).  The Committee will employ the tiebreaker at Section 10325(c)(9) in an effort to assure that no single housing type will exceed the following percentage goals where other housing type maximums are not yet reached:\n\n| Housing Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Goal                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Large Family                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 65%                            |\n| Large Family New Construction receiving the tiebreaker increase for being located in census tracts, or census block groups as applicable, designated on the CTCAC/HCD Opportunity Area Map as Highest or High Resource Areas | 30%                            |\n| Special Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 40%                            |\n| Single Room Occupancy (SRO)                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 15%                            |\n| At-Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 15%                            |\n| Seniors                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 20%                            |\n| Rural Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation                                                                                                                                                                                      | 30% of rural set-aside credits |\n\nFor purposes of the Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation Housing Type goal within the Rural set aside, a project will be considered an acquisition and/or rehabilitation project if at least 50% of the units were previously residential dwelling units.\n\nA large family new construction project that receives a tiebreaker increase in Section 10325(c)(9) for being located in a Highest or High Resource census tract shall count against both that housing type and the general Large Family housing type.\n\n- (i) Geographic Apportionments.

In accordance with the R &amp; T Code Sections 12205, 12206, 17057.5, 17058, 23610.4 and 23610.5, there shall be allowed as a Credit against the 'tax' (as defined by R &amp; T Code Section 12201) a State Tax Credit for Federal Credit Ceiling projects pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(A) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Tax Exempt Bond Projects pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(B) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in an amount equal to no more than 30 percent (30%) of the project's requested construction-related  eligible  basis.  Except  for  State  Farmworker  Credits  and  projects  meeting subparagraphs (A) through (D) in subsection (c)(4) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the maximum State Tax Credit award amount for a Tax Exempt Bond Project pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(A) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or basis described in paragraph (f) below, is 13 percent (13%) of that project's requested eligible basis. The maximum State Farmworker Credit award amount for a Tax-Exempt Bond Project,  or  basis  described  in  paragraph  (f)  below,  is  75  percent  (75%)  of  that  project's requested eligible basis. The maximum State Credit award for a project meeting subparagraphs (A) through (D) in subsection (c)(4) of 12206 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or basis described in paragraph (f) below, is 95 percent (95%) of that project's requested eligible basis. Insufficient credits  due to  a  low  appraised  value  as  described  in  Subparagraph (C) shall be evidenced as defined in Section 10322(h)(9)(A) of these Regulations: the sum of third-party debt encumbering the  seller's  property  exceeds  the  appraised  value.    Substantial  rehabilitation  as  described  in Subparagraph  (D)  shall  be  evidenced  by  Section  10326(g)(7)  of  these  Regulations.    Award amounts shall be computed in accordance with IRC Section 42, except as otherwise provided in\n\napplicable sections of the R &amp; T Code. For purposes of calculating the final State Tax Credit amount on the Form(s) 3521A, the project's actual eligible basis may be used.\n\n- (b) Allocation  of  Federal  Tax  Credits  required.    State  Tax  Credit  recipients  shall  have  first  been awarded Federal Tax Credits, or shall qualify for Tax Credits under Section 42(h)(4)(b), as required under  H  &amp;  S  Code  Section  50199.14(e)  and  the  R  &amp;  T  Code  Section  12206(b)(1)(A).    State Farmworker Credits are exempt from this requirement.\n- (c) Limit on Credit amount.\n- (1) Except for applications described in paragraph (d) below, all credit ceiling applications may request State credits provided the project application is not requesting the federal 130% basis adjustment for purposes of calculating the federal credit award amount.  Projects are eligible for State credits regardless of their location within a federal Qualified Census Tract (QCT)  or  a  Difficult  Development  Area  (DDA).  Notwithstanding  paragraph  (d)  below, applications for the Federal Credit established by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2020  or  the  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act,  2021  are  not  eligible  for  State  Tax Credits.\n- (2) An applicant requesting state credits shall not reduce basis related to federal tax credits except to reduce requested basis to the project's threshold basis limit or the credit request to the amount available in the project's geographic region or the limits described in Section 10325(f)(9)(C). CTCAC shall revise the basis and credit request if the applicant fails to meet this requirement.\n- (3) In  the  event  that  reservations  of  state  credits  to  credit  ceiling  applications  exceed  the amount of state credits available, CTCAC post-reservation shall designate applications for which  there  are  insufficient  state  credits  as  difficult  development  area  (DDA)  projects pursuant to Section 10327(d)(3) and exchange state credits for federal credits in an amount that will yield equal equity based solely on the tax credit factors stated in the application and may exceed the maximum annual Federal Tax Credits in Section 10325(f)(9)(C).\n- (4) For projects applying for State Tax Credits in paragraph (j), the maximum request for any one  project  in  any  funding  round  shall  not  exceed  Two  Hundred  Thousand  ($200,000) dollars per Tax Credit Unit. Farmworker Housing projects are exempt from this requirement.\n- (d) (1) Under authority granted by Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 12206(b)(2)(E)(ii), 17058(b)(2)(E)(ii), and 23610.5(b)(2)(E)(ii), applications for Special Needs projects with at least 50% of the Low-Income Units designated as special needs units and within a QCT or DDA  may  request  the  federal  130%  basis  boost  and  may  also  request  State  credits, provided that the applicant does not reduce basis related to federal tax credits except to reduce requested basis to the project's threshold basis limit or the credit request to the amount  available  in  the  project's  geographic  region  or  the  limits  described  in  Section 10325(f)(9)(C).  CTCAC shall revise the basis and credit request if the application fails to meet  this  requirement.  Under  authority  granted  by  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section 42(d)(5)(B)(v), CTCAC designates Special Needs housing type applicants for credit ceiling credits as Difficult Development Area projects, regardless of their location within a federally designated QCT or DDA.\n- (2) Under authority granted by Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 12206(b)(2)(E)(iii),17058(b)(2)(E)(iii), and 23610.5(b)(2)(E)(iii), applications for 4% federal tax credits plus State Farmworker Credits within a QCT or DDA may request the federal 130% basis boost and may also request State credits\n- (3) Under  authority  granted  by  Revenue  and  Taxation  Code  Sections  12206(b)(2)(E)(iii), 17058(b)(2)(E)(iii), and 23610.5(b)(2)(E)(iii), new construction applications for 4% federal tax credits plus State Credits pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(B) of Sections 12206, 17058,\n\nand 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code within a QCT or DDA may request the federal 130% basis boost and may also request State credits.\n\n- (4) Applications for the Federal Credit established by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, including Special Needs projects described in this section (d), are not eligible for State Tax Credits.\n2. (e) State Tax Credit exchange.  Applications for projects not possessing one of the allocation priorities described  in  subsection  (d)  may  also  include  a  request  for  State  Tax  Credits.    During  any reservation  cycle  and/or  following  any  reservation  or  allocation  of  State  Tax  Credits  to  all applications meeting the above allocation priorities, remaining balances of State Tax Credits maybe awarded to applicants having received a reservation of Federal Tax Credits during the same year, in exchange for the 'equivalent' amount of Federal Tax Credits.  Said exchanges shall be offered at  the  discretion  of  the  Executive  Director,  who  may  consider  and  account  for  any  fiscal  or administrative impacts on the project or applicant pool when deciding to whom he/she will offer State Tax Credits.\n3. (f) Acquisition  Tax  Credits.    State  Tax  Credits  for  acquisition  basis  are  allowed  only  for  projects meeting the definition of a project 'at risk of conversion,' pursuant to Section 42 and R &amp; T Code Section 17058(c)(4).\n\n## (g) Tax-Exempt Bond Financing.\n\n- (1) Projects financed under the tax-exempt bond financing provisions of Section 42(h)(4)(b) of the IRC, subsection (g)(1)(A) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 10326 of these regulations may apply for State Tax Credits if the following conditions are met:\n2. (A) the  project  is  comprised  of  100%  Tax  Credit  Units.  Excepted  from  this  rule  are projects proposed for acquisition and rehabilitation that were developed under the HUD  Section  236  or  202  programs,  and  are  subject  to  those  programs'  use restrictions. Projects under those circumstances may propose a lesser percentage of Tax Credit Units to accommodate existing over-income residents who originally qualified under Section 236 or 202 income eligibility;\n3. (B) one or more buildings is not eligible for the 130% basis adjustment, in which case the State Tax Credits shall be available only for the buildings not eligible for the 130% basis adjustment. This paragraph shall not apply to projects referenced in Section 10317(d);\n4. (C) State Tax Credits will not be available to projects that have already received a reservation of 4% credit in the previous year; and\n- (2) For projects financed under the tax-exempt bond financing provisions of Section 42(h)(4)(b) of the IRC, subsection (g)(1)(B) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 10326 of these regulations applying for State Tax Credits. State Tax Credits will not be available to projects that have already received a reservation of 4% credit in a previous year.\n\n## (h) State Farmworker Credit.\n\n- (1) Applicants  may  request  State  Farmworker  Credits  for  eligible  Farmworker  Housing  in combination with federal credits, or they may request State Farmworker Credits only. If seeking a federal Credit Ceiling reservation, applicants may apply only during competitive rounds  as  announced  by  CTCAC  and  shall  compete  under  the  provisions  of  Section 10325(c) et. seq.  If requesting federal credits for use with tax exempt bond financing, or State Farmworker Credits only, applicants may apply over the counter and shall meet the threshold requirements for projects requesting 4% federal credits.\n\n- (2) If more than one applicant is requesting nine percent (9%) federal credits in combination with State Farmworker Credits during a competitive round, CTCAC shall award available State Farmworker Credits to the highest scoring Farmworker Housing application that will receive a reservation of federal credits.\n- (3) If  available State Farmworker Credits are inadequate to fully fund a pending request for eligible Farmworker Housing, CTCAC may reserve a forward commitment of subsequent year's State Farmworker Credits for that project alone.\n3. (i) State  Tax  Credit  Allocations  pursuant  to  subsection  (g)(1)(A)  of  Sections  12206,  17058,  and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to bond financed projects.  The following parameters apply:\n- (1) In calendar years where there are additional state tax credits available to bond financed projects, an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the annual State Tax Credit authority will be available for acquisition and/or rehabilitation bond financed projects, with a ranking priority for projects meeting subparagraphs (A) through (D) in subsection (c)(4) of 12206 of the Revenue and Tax Code. In all other years, an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the annual State Tax Credit authority will be available for bond financed projects of any construction type. CTCAC shall make reservations up to the 15% limit beginning with the first application review period of a calendar year for tax-exempt bond financed projects;\n- (2) The project will be competitively scored by CDLAC according to the CDLAC scoring and ranking system delineated in Section 5230 of the CDLAC Regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  existing  tax  credit  projects  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  Section 10326(g)(8)(A);\n- (3) If the 15% set-aside has not been reserved prior to year end it may be used in a State Tax Credit exchange for projects that have received 9% Tax Credit reservations;\n- (4) The Committee may reserve an amount in excess of the 15% set-aside of State Tax Credits for the last funded tax-exempt bond financed project if that project requires more than the State Tax Credits remaining in this set aside if (1) fewer than half of the State Tax Credits annually  available  for  the  credit  ceiling  competition  are  reserved  in  the  first  competitive credit round, or (2) if State Credits remain available after funding of competitive projects in the second CTCAC funding round.\n- (5) Staff shall identify high-cost projects by comparing each scored project's total eligible basis against its total adjusted threshold basis limits, excluding any increase for deeper targeting pursuant to Section 10327(c)(5)(C). CTCAC shall calculate total eligible basis consistent with the method described in Section 10325(d), except that the amount of developer fee in basis  that  exceeds  the  project's  deferral/contribution  threshold  described  in  Section 10327(c)(2)(B) shall be excluded. A project will be designated 'high cost' if a project's total eligible  basis  exceeds  its  total  adjusted  threshold  basis  limit  by  30%.  Staff  shall  not recommend such project for credits. Any project may be subject to negative points if the project's total eligible basis at placed in service exceeds the revised total adjusted threshold basis limits for the year the project is placed in service (or the original total eligible threshold basis limit if higher) by 40%.\n9. (j) State  Tax  Credit  Allocations  pursuant  to  subsection  (g)(1)(B)  of  Sections  12206,  17058,  and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\n- (1) For  calendar  years  beginning  in  2021,  an  amount  up  to  five  hundred  million  dollars ($500,000,000)  in  total  State  Tax  Credit  authority  will  be  available  (if  authorized  in  the California Budget Act or related legislation) for new construction Tax Exempt Bond Projects, including retrofitting or repurposing of existing nonresidential structures that were converted\n\nto residential use within the previous five years from the date of application subject to the requirements of the CDLAC regulations and the requirements of Section 10326 of these regulations. For calendar years 2024 to 2034 where any additional credits are available pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(B) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the lesser of five percent (5%) or $25,000,000 shall be available to Farmworker Housing. Any credits pursuant to this clause that remain unallocated following the conclusion of a funding round shall roll over to the subsequent funding rounds in that calendar year with the exception that any credits that remain unallocated after the final funding round in that calendar year shall be added back to the aggregate amount of credits that may be allocated pursuant to this subparagraph. The approximate amount of State Tax Credits available in each reservation cycle shall be established by the Committee annually at a public meeting.\n\n- (2) No later than the CDLAC bond issuance deadline, the applicant must submit to CTCAC building permits (a grading permit does not suffice to meet this requirement except that in the  event  that  the  city  or  county  as  a  rule  does  not  issue  building  permits  prior  to  the completion of grading, a grading permit shall suffice; if the project is a design-build project in which the city or county does not issue building permits until designs are fully complete, the  city  or  county  shall  have  approved  construction  to  begin)  or  the  applicable  tribal documents, and notice to proceed delivered to the contractor.\n- (3) Failure to submit said documents to CTCAC by the CDLAC bond issuance deadline shall result in rescission of the Tax Credit Reservation and may result in assessment of negative points.\n3. (k) All projects that have received state credits shall comply with the limitations on cash distributions required pursuant to Sections 12206(d), 17058(d), and 23610.5(d) of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\n- (1) In the initial application, applicants requesting state credits shall make an election to sell ('certificate') or not sell all or any portion of the state credit, as allowed pursuant to Revenue and  Taxation  Code  Sections  12206(o),  17058(q),  and  23610.5(r).  The  applicant  for  a certificated credit shall be a non-profit entity and the state credit price shall not be less than eighty (80) cents per dollar of credit.  The applicant may, only once, revoke an election to sell at any time before CTCAC issues the Form(s) 3521A for the project, at which the point the election shall become irrevocable.\n- (2) An applicant who elects to sell any portion of the state credit and a buyer who later resells any portion of the credit shall report to CTCAC within 10 days of the sale of the credit, in a form specified by CTCAC, all required information regarding the purchase and sale of the credit, including the social security or other taxpayer identification number of the party or parties to whom the credit has been sold, the face amount of the credit sold, and the amount of consideration received for the sale of the credit.  At the request of the owner, CTCAC shall reissue the Form(s) 3521A in the name of the buyer.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.

Except  for  reservations  made  pursuant  to  Section  10325(h)  of  these  Regulations, Reservations of Tax Credits shall occur only at scheduled meetings of the Committee, which shall announce application-filing deadlines and the approximate dates of reservation meetings as early in the year as possible.\n\n- (b) Approvals required by this Section 10320(b) shall not be unreasonably withheld if all of the following requirements, as applicable, are satisfied:\n- (1) No allocation of the Federal or State Credits, or ownership of a Tax Credit project, may be transferred without prior written approval of the Executive Director.  In the event that prior written  approval  is  not  obtained,  the  Executive  Director  may  assess  negative  points pursuant  to  section  10325(c)(2)(M),  in  addition  to  other  remedies.  Subparagraphs  (A) through (C) apply to all ownership or Tax Credit transfers requested after January 31, 2014. Subparagraphs (A) through (E) apply to all ownership or Tax Credit transfers requested after April 3, 2024:\n- (A) Any  transfer  of  project  ownership  (including  changes  to  any  general  partner, member,  or  equivalent  responsible  party),  or  allocation  of  Tax  Credits  shall  be evidenced by a written  agreement  between the parties  to  the  transfer,  including agreements entered into by the transferee and the Committee.\n- (B) The entity replacing a party or acquiring ownership or Tax Credits shall be subject to  a  'qualifications  review'  by  the  Committee  to  determine  if  sufficient  project development and management experience is present for owning and operating a Tax  Credit  project.    Information  regarding  the  names  of  the  purchaser(s)  or transferee(s),  and  detailed  information  describing  the  experience  and  financial capacity of said persons, shall be provided to the Committee.  Any general partner change during the 15-year federal compliance and extended use period must be to a  party  earning  equal  capacity  points  pursuant  to  Section  10325(c)(1)(A)  as  the exiting general partner.  At a minimum this must be three (3) projects in service more than three years, or the demonstrated training required under Section 10326(g)(5). Two  of  the  three  projects  must  be  Low  Income  Housing  Tax  Credit  projects  in California.  If the new general partner does not meet these experience requirements, then substitution of general partner shall not be permitted. The requirements of this paragraph  apply  to  a  change  to  any  general  partner,  member,  or  equivalent responsible party where an exiting party meets the experience capacity and the remaining party does not have experience equal to the minimum stated above.\n- (C) The transferor shall deliver all tenant files, inspection records, financial statements, and  reserve  balances  to  the  transferee  prior  to  or  concurrent  with  the  transfer. Failure to deliver such records may subject the transferor to negative points or a fine.\n- (D) The Executive Director shall not approve a transfer if, in any of the five calendar years prior to the transfer date or in the year to date of the transfer but not earlier than April 3, 2024, the owner has increased the rent for any low-income household in excess of the amounts described in Section 10336(a).\n- (E) The transferee shall annually certify that they have not increased the rent for any low-income household in excess of the amounts described in Section 10336(a).\n- (2) In  addition  to  any  applicable  requirements  set  forth  in  Section  10320(b)(1),  all  Transfer Events shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Executive Director. In the event that  prior  written  approval  is  not  obtained,  the  Executive  Director  may  assess  negative points  pursuant  to  section  10325(c)(2)(M),  in  addition  to  other  remedies.    The  following requirements  apply  to  all  Transfer  Events  for  which  approval  is  requested  on  or  after October 21, 2015:\n- (A) Prior  to  a  Transfer  Event,  the  owner  of  the  project  shall  submit  to  the  Executive Director a Qualified Capital Needs Assessment. In the case of a Transfer Event in which  a  third-party  lender  is  providing  financing,  the  Qualified  Capital  Needs Assessment shall be commissioned by said third-party lender.\n\n- (B) The entity which shall own the project subsequent to the Transfer Event (the 'Post Transfer Owner') shall covenant to the Committee (the 'Capital Needs Covenant') that the Post Transfer Owner (and any assignee thereof) shall:\n- (i) set aside at the closing of the Transfer Event adequate funds to perform the Short Term Work (the 'Short Term Work Reserve Amount');\n- (ii) perform  the  Short  Term  Work  within  three  (3)  years  from  the  date  of  the Transfer Event;\n- (iii) make deposits to reserves as are necessary to fund the Long Term Work, taking into account any balance in replacement reserve accounts upon the conclusion  of  the  Transfer  Event  beyond  those  required  by  clause  (i). Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Post  Transfer  Owner  shall  have  no obligation to fund any reserve amount from annual operations to the extent that  the  funding  of  the  reserve  causes  the  project  to  have  a  debt  service coverage  ratio  of  less  than  1.00  to  1.00.  In  calculating  the  debt  service coverage ratio for the purposes herein, the property management fee shall not exceed the greater of (a) 7% the project's effective gross income, or (b) such  amount  approved  by  HUD  or  USDA,  as  applicable.  Any  property management fee in excess of these limitations shall be subordinate to the funding of the required reserves and shall not be considered when calculating the debt service coverage ratio; and\n- (iv) complete the Long Term Work when required, or prior thereto, pursuant to the Qualified CNA.\n- (C) The  Executive  Director  may  waive  or  modify  the  requirements  of  this  Section 10320(b)(2)(A) and (B) if the owner can demonstrate that the Transfer Event will not produce,  prior  to  any  distributions  of  Net  Project  Equity  to  parties  related  to  the sponsor, developer, limited partner(s) or general partner(s), sufficient Net Project Equity to fund all or any portion of the work contemplated by the Qualified CNA. There  shall  be  a  presumption  that  a  Transfer  Event  has  insufficient  Net  Project Equity (and the requirements of this Section 10320(b)(2)(A) and (B) shall be waived) if no Net Project Equity from the Transfer Event is distributed to parties related to the sponsor, developer, general partner(s) or limited partner(s) of the owner other than a distribution or a payment to the limited partner(s) of the selling entity in the amount equal to, or less than, all federal, state, and local taxes incurred by the limited partner(s) as a result of the Transfer Event.\n- (3) The Capital Needs Covenant shall at all times be subordinate to any deed of trust given to any  third  party  lender  to  a  project.  The  owner  of  a  project  subject  to  a  Capital  Needs Covenant shall certify compliance with the terms of said Capital Needs Covenant to CTCAC annually for the term of the Capital Needs Covenant on a form to be developed by the Executive Director. Failure to comply with the terms of the Capital Needs Covenant may subject the owner to negative points and/or a ban on buying or receiving future properties.\n- (4) If a project seeks to receive a new reservation of 9% or 4% tax credits concurrently with a Transfer Event or during the time that the project is subject to a Capital Needs Covenant, the following provisions shall apply in lieu of paragraph (2):\n- (A) The applicant shall submit a Qualified CNA.  In cases in which a third-party lender is providing financing, the Qualified CNA shall be commissioned by said third-party lender.\n\n- (B) The rehabilitation  scope  of  work  shall  include  all  of  the  Short  Term  Work.    The applicant may receive eligible basis for the costs of the Short Term Work only if the applicant  can  demonstrate  that  the  Short  Term  Work  was  funded  by  one  of  the following:\n- (i) a credit from the seller of the project equal to the costs of Short Term Work.\n- (ii)  a reduction in the purchase price of the project as compared to the purchase price of the project had the project not been subject to the Transfer Event requirement, as shown by an appraisal that calculates the impact of the Short Term Work requirement on value.\n- (iii) general partner equity.\n- (iv) developer fee contributed to the project (a deferred developer fee does not qualify).\n- (C) After the Transfer Event giving rise to the covenant required pursuant to Section 10320(b)(2)(B) (the 'Initial Transfer'), if the project will be subsequently transferred in  connection  with  the  closing  of  the  new  reservation  of  9%  or  4%  credits  (a 'Subsequent Transfer'), any increase in acquisition price (if the Initial Transfer was a sale) or the project valuation (if the Initial Transfer was a refinancing) between the Initial Transfer and the Subsequent Transfer which is attributable to a reduction in the amount of annual deposits into the replacement reserve account from those required pursuant to Section 10320(b)(2)(B)(iii) because all or a portion of the Long Term Work will be performed in connection with the new reservation of 9% or 4% credits, must be evidenced in the form of (i) a seller carryback note or (ii) a general partner equity contribution.\n- (D) Upon the closing of the syndication of the new 9% or 4% credits reserved for the project,  any  Capital  Needs  Covenant  shall  automatically  terminate  without  any further action of the project owner and/or the Committee.\n- (E) The  Executive  Director  shall  waive  or  modify  the  requirements  of  this  Section 10320(b)(4) if the owner can demonstrate that the Transfer Event will not produce, prior  to  any  distributions  of  Net  Project  Equity  to  parties  related  to  the  sponsor, developer, limited partner(s) or general partner(s), sufficient Net Project Equity to fund all or any portion of the work contemplated by the Qualified CNA. There shall be a presumption that a Transfer Event has insufficient Net Project Equity if no Net Project Equity from the Transfer Event is distributed to parties related to the sponsor, developer,  general  partner(s)  or  limited  partner(s)  of  the  owner  other  than  a distribution or a payment to the limited partner(s) of the selling entity in the amount equal  to,  or  less  than,  all  federal,  state,  and  local  taxes  incurred  by  the  limited partner(s) as a result of the Transfer Event.\n- (F) Sections 10320(b)(4)(B) and 10320(b)(4)(C) shall not be applicable to any project with an existing tax credit regulatory agreement with a remaining term of five (5) or less years.\n- (5) No management company of an existing or new tax credit project shall be replaced without prior written approval of the Executive Director.  In the event that prior written approval is not obtained, the Executive Director may assess negative points or a fine. With respect to 4% tax credit  projects,  management  companies  ineligible  for  at  least  two  management company  experience  points  pursuant  to  Section  10325(c)(1)(B)  shall  obtain  training  in project operations, on-site certification, Fair Housing Law, and manager certification in IRS Section  42  program  requirements  from  CTCAC  or  a  CTCAC-approved,  nationally recognized  entity.    The  out-going  management  company  shall  deliver  all  tenant  files, inspection records, financial statements, and reserve balances to the in-coming management company prior to  or  concurrent  with  the  transfer.    Failure  to  deliver  such records may subject the out-going management company to negative points or a fine.\n\n- (6) Except for resyndication applications without a distribution of Net Project Equity, if a project seeks to receive a new reservation of 9% or 4% tax credits, any uncorrected Form(s) 8823 for  life  and  safety  violations  (life-threatening  and  non-life  threatening)  and  for  Uniform Physical Condition Standards violations that are in existence at the time of the CTCAC application must be corrected by the project owner that received the Form(s) 8823.  The resyndication application shall not include any costs to correct these Form(s) 8823.\n- (7) An applicant seeking to (1) demolish or similarly alter any of the existing structures currently subject to CTCAC regulatory restrictions when seeking a new reservation of 9% and/or 4% tax credits; and/or (2) separate an existing project currently subject to CTCAC regulatory restrictions  into  multiple  projects  must  request  and  receive  prior  written  approval  of  the Executive  Director.    Projects  that  involve  the  demolition  of  existing  residential  units  or separating an existing project must increase the unit count by (i) 25 or (ii) 50% of the existing demolished units, whichever is greater, unless, for existing SRO projects, waived by the Executive Director provided that the applicant demonstrates that full compliance would be impractical.\n- (8) A project owner seeking to sell a portion of vacant or unused land must request and receive prior  written  approval  of  the  Executive  Director.    The  sales  proceeds must either: 1) be contributed (not loaned) to a new multifamily affordable housing restricted project; or 2) reduce rents at the existing property by the aggregate amount of the proceeds.  The project owner must request and receive prior written approval of the Executive Director.\n4. (c) CTCAC shall initially subordinate its regulatory contract to a permanent lender but thereafter shall not subordinate existing regulatory contracts to acquisition or refinancing debt, except in relation to new Deeds of Trust for rehabilitation loans, FHA-insured loans, restructured public loans, or as otherwise permitted by the Executive Director. At the request of the owner, CTCAC shall enter into a stand-still agreement permitting the acquisition or refinance lender 60 days to work with the owner to remedy a breach of the regulatory contract prior to CTCAC implementing any of the remedies in the regulatory contract, except that CTCAC shall not enter into a stand-still agreement related to a Transfer Event requested on or after October 21, 2015 unless the conditions of Section 10320(b)(2) have been satisfied. If CTCAC enters into a stand-still agreement related to a Transfer Event, Sections 10320(b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) shall apply to the project.\n5. (d) False information.  Upon being informed, or finding, that information supplied by an applicant, any person acting on behalf of an applicant, or any team member identified in the application, pursuant to these regulations, is false or no longer true, and the applicant has not notified CTCAC in writing, the Committee may take appropriate action as described in H &amp; S Code Section 50199.22(b) and in  section  10325(c)(2)  of  these  regulations.    Additionally  the  Executive  Director  may  assess negative  points  to  any  or  all  members  of  the  development  team  as  described  in  Section 10322(h)(5).\n6. (e) CTCAC shall not enter into a qualified contract, as defined in IRC Section 42(h)(6)(F).\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.

(F) A description  of  any  unique  features  of  the  site,  noting  those  that  may  increase project costs or require environmental mitigation.\n- (9) Appraisals.  Appraisals are required for:1) all rehabilitation applications except as noted in subsection (A), below, 2) all adaptive reuse applications, 3) all competitive applications, except for new construction projects that are on tribal trust land or that have submitted a third party purchase contract with, or evidence of a purchase from, an unrelated third party, 4) all applications seeking tiebreaker credit for donated or leased land, or land with a soft loan and 5) all new construction applications involving a land sale from a related party. For purposes of this paragraph only, a purchase contract or sale with a related party shall be deemed  to  be  a  purchase  contract  or  sale  with  an  unrelated  party  if  the  applicant demonstrates that the related party is acting solely as a pass-through entity and the tax credit partnership is only paying the acquisition price from the last arms-length transaction, plus any applicable and reasonable carrying costs. Appraisals shall not include the value of favorable financing.\n\nAppraisals must be prepared by a California certified general appraiser having no identity of  interest  with  the  development's  partner(s)  or  intended  partner  or  general  contractor, acceptable to the Committee, and include, at a minimum, the following:\n\n- (i) the  highest  and  best  use  of  the  proposed  project  as  residential  rental property, considering any on-going recorded rent restrictions;\n- (ii) for rehabilitation applications, the Sales Comparison Approach and Income Approach  valuation  methodologies  shall  be  used;  for  new  construction applications,  the  Sales  Comparison  Approach  shall  be  used;  for  adaptive\n\nreuse applications, the Cost Approach valuation methodology shall be used for  adaptive reuse of office buildings, retail buildings, and similar, and the Sales Comparison and Income Approaches may be used for hotels, motels, and similar;\n\n- (iii) the appraiser's reconciled value, in cases that require multiple methodologies;\n- (iv) a value for the land of the subject property ('as if vacant');\n- (v) an on-site inspection; and\n- (vi) a purchase contract verifying the sales price of the subject property.\n- (A) Rehabilitation applications.

Projects for which an appraisal is required above shall provide an 'as-is' appraisal with a date of value that is within either:\n- (i) 120 days before or after the execution of a purchase contract; for leased land, an executed development agreement negotiated between the landowner and the  applicant  or  developer;  an  option  agreement;  any  other  site  control document pursuant to Section 10325(f)(2); the transfer of ownership by all the parties, or\n- (ii) one year of the application date if the latest purchase contract, development agreement, option agreement, or any other site control document pursuant to Section 10325(f)(2) was executed within that year.\n\nAn amendment to an agreement does not constitute any of the agreements listed in (i) or (ii) above.\n\n- (C) Adaptive  reuse  applications.    All  adaptive  reuse  applications  must  submit  an appraisal  using  an  'as-is'  appraisal  date  of  value  as  stated  in  (B)  above.    For applications required to use the Cost Approach, the appraisal must consider the age, condition, and depreciated value of the existing building(s) when utilizing newly constructed 'shell' sales comparisons and must include these calculations in the report.\n\nFor applications with existing project-based rental subsidy, the Income Approach shall not include post-rehabilitation contract rent(s).  Rent(s) used in the Income Approach, if not the existing approved contract rent, must be supported by a rent comparable study or similar. For applications with existing affordability restrictions, the Income Approach must be based on the affordability restrictions and restricted rents encumbering the property (a 'restricted value') unless all affordability restrictions will expire within five years.\n\nCTCAC may contract with an appraisal reviewer who may review submitted appraisals.  If it does so, CTCAC shall commission an appraisal review.  If the appraisal review finds the submitted appraisal to be inappropriate, misleading, or inconsistent with the data reported and  with  other  generally  known  information,  then  the  reviewer  shall  develop  their  own opinion of value and CTCAC shall use the opinion of value established by the appraisal reviewer.\n\n- (10) Market  Studies.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was administered by CTCAC under regulations adopted October 22, 2009.  Awards made under those prior regulations remain bound by the terms of related executed funding agreements, and regulatory agreements.\n- (b) Fees.\n- (1) No  additional  processing  fees  or  performance  deposits  shall  be  collected  from  ARRA funding recipients beyond tax credit fees collected pursuant to Section 10335.  Such tax credit fees must be paid by all ARRA fund recipients, including an allocation fee, even where an allocation of credits is not ultimately made.  CTCAC may charge an ARRA funds recipient an asset management fee for such services.  This fee may be in the form of an annual charge  during  the  project's  regulatory  term,  or  may  be  charged  at  or  about  project completion.    In  the  event  CTCAC  contracts  out  for  asset  management  services,  the contracted entity may charge the sponsor an asset management fee directly.\n- (2) Asset management fees shall be $5,000 annually for projects of 30 units or fewer, and up to $7,500 annually for projects of 31 to 75 units.  Projects containing more than 75 units, will pay up to $7,500 as a basic asset management fee annually, as well $40 per unit of every unit over 75 units.  Project owners may pay a one-time asset management fee equal to the total fee over the 15-year period, or a partial one-time upfront fee.  If making a partial payment, the remaining annual payments shall be discounted accordingly to assure an\n\nequal total payment to a pure annual payment schedule.  Where another State or federal housing entity is a project funding source, project sponsors may propose a plan to CTCAC wherein that source shares asset management information with CTCAC.  Sponsors may also propose a plan to CTCAC where a syndicator or investor providing professional asset management services to the project shares asset management information with CTCAC.  If CTCAC determines that those asset management functions meet federal requirements, CTCAC may agree to accept that information and discount or forgo a fee altogether\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.

      "content": "## Section 10325.  Application Selection Criteria - Credit Ceiling Applications.\n\n- (a) General.  All applications not requesting Federal Tax Credits under the requirements of IRC Section 42(h)(4)(b) and Section 10326 of these Regulations (for buildings financed by tax-exempt bonds) shall  compete for  reservations  of  Credit  Ceiling  amounts  during  designated  reservation  cycles. Further, projects that have pending applications for a private activity bond allocation or that have previously  received  private  activity  bond  allocations  that  have  not  been  returned  as  of  the application filing deadline are ineligible to compete under the Credit Ceiling competition for Federal Tax Credits.\n- (b) Authority.  Selection criteria shall include those required by IRC Section 42(m), H &amp; S Code Section 50199.14, and R &amp; T Code Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5.\n- (c) Credit Ceiling application competitions.  Applications received in a reservation cycle, and competing for Federal and/or State Tax Credits, shall be scored and ranked according to the below-described criteria, except as modified by Section 10317(g) of these regulations.  The Committee shall reserve the right to determine, on a case-by-case basis, under the unique circumstances of each funding round, and in consideration of the relative scores and ranking of the proposed projects, that a project's score is too low to warrant a reservation of Tax Credits.  All point selection categories shall  be  met  in  the  application  submission  through  a  presentation  of  conclusive,  documented evidence to the Executive Director's satisfaction.  Point scores shall be determined solely on the application as submitted, including any additional information submitted in compliance with these regulations . Further, a project's points will be based solely on the current year's scoring criteria and submissions, without respect to any prior year's score for the same projects.\n\nScattered Site Projects shall be scored proportionately in the site and service amenities category based upon (i) each site's score, and (ii) the percentage of units represented by each site, except that for scattered site projects of less than 20 Low-Income Units, service amenities shall be scored in the aggregate across all sites.\n\nThe number of awards received by individuals, entities, affiliates, and related entities is limited to no more than four (4) per competitive round.  This limitation is applicable to a project applicant, developer, sponsor, owner, general partner, and to parent companies, principals of entities, and family members.  For the purposes of this section, related or non-arm's length relationships are further defined as those having control or joint-control over an entity, having significant influence over an entity, or participating as key management of an entity.  Related entity disclosure is required at  the  time  of  application.    Furthermore,  no  application  submitted  by  a  sponsor  may  benefit competitively  by  the  withdrawal  of  another,  higher-ranked  application  submitted  by  the  same sponsor or related parties as described above.\n\n## SCORING\n\n- (1) General Partner/Management Company Characteristics.\n\nNo one general partner, party having any fiduciary responsibilities, or related parties will be awarded more than 15% of the Federal Credit Ceiling, calculated as of February first during any calendar year unless imposing this requirement would prevent allocation of all of the available Credit Ceiling.\n\n- (A) General partner experience.  To receive points under this subsection for projects in existence for more than three years, a proposed general partner, or a key person within the proposed  general  partner  organization, must  meet  the  following conditions:\n- (i) For projects in operation for more than three years, submit a certification from a third party certified public accountant that the projects for which it is requesting  points  have  maintained  a  positive  operating  cash  flow,  from typical  residential  income  alone  (e.g.  rents,  rental  subsidies,  late  fees, forfeited  deposits,  etc.)  for  the  year  in  which  each  development's  last financial  statement  has  been  prepared  and  have  funded  reserves  in accordance  with  the  partnership  agreement  and  any  applicable  loan documents. To obtain points for projects previously owned by the proposed general partner, a similar certification must be submitted with respect to the last  full  year  of  ownership  by  the  proposed  general  partner,  along  with verification of the number of years that the project was owned by that general partner.  To obtain points for projects previously owned, the ending date of ownership  or  participation  must  be  no  more  than  10  years  from  the application  deadline.    This  certification  must  list  the  specific  projects  for which the points are being requested.  The certification of the third party certified public accountant may be in the form of an agreed upon procedure report that includes funded reserves as of the report date, which shall be dated within 60 days of the application deadline, unless the general partner or key person has no current projects which are eligible for points in which case the report date shall be after the date from which the general partner or key person separated from the last eligible project.  If the certification is prepared for a first-round application utilizing prepared financial statements of the previous calendar year, the certification may be submitted in a second round application, exceeding the 60 day requirement above.  Where there is more than one general partner, experience points may not be aggregated; rather, points will be awarded based on the highest points for which 1 general partner is eligible.\n\nThree to four projects in service more than three years, of which one shall be in service more than five years and two shall be California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects 5 points\n\nFive or more projects in service more than three years, of which one shall be in  service  more  than  five  years  and  two  shall  be  California  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects 7 points\n\nFor special needs housing type projects only applying through the Nonprofit set-aside or Special Needs set-aside only, points are available as described above or as follows:\n\nThree  Special  Needs  projects  in  service  more  than  three  years  and  one California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project which may or may not be one of the three special needs projects 5 points\n\nFour or more Special Needs projects in service more than three years and one California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project which may or may not be one of the four special needs projects 7 points\n\n- (ii)  General  partners  with  fewer  than  two  (2)  active  California  Low  Income Housing Tax Credit projects in service more than three years, and general partners for projects applying through the Nonprofit or Special Needs setaside with no active California Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in service more than three years, shall contract with a bona-fide management company currently managing two (2) California Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in service more than three years and which itself earns a minimum total of two (2) points at the time of application.\n- (iii)  Tribal applicants may contract with a developer who will not be a general partner and receive points commensurate with the developer's experience pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii). The contract shall be in effect at least until the  issuance  of  8609  tax  forms.  Tribal  applicants  exercising  this  option, including  the  option  in  the  next  paragraph,  shall  also  contract  for  asset management for at least the term of the 15-year federal compliance period with an entity that has asset managed at least two Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects for more than three years.\n\nFor  purposes of  this  clause  only,  a  developer  may  include  an  entity  preapproved by CTCAC that has developed but not owned the requisite number of projects described in (i) and that provides the certification from a third party certified  public  accountant  described  above  for  the  projects  for  which experience points are requested. If the projects for which the entity requests experience  points  do  not  include  two  (2)  active  California  Low  Income Housing Tax Credit projects in service more than three years, the applicant shall contract with a bona-fide management company pursuant to clause (ii). For this purpose only, 'develop' shall mean developing the project scope and  timeline,  securing  financing,  hiring  or  performing  the  services  of  a general contractor, and overseeing completion of construction and placement in service as well as asset managing the project for at least three years after  placed  in  service.  When  seeking  pre-approval  the  entity  shall provide copies of contracts demonstrating that the standards have been met.\n\nIn  applying  for  and  receiving  points  in  this  category,  applicants  assure  that  the property  shall  be  operated  by  a  general  partner  in  conformance  with  Section 10320(b).\n\n- (B) Management Company experience.  To receive points under this subsection, the property  management  company  must  meet  the  following  conditions.    To  obtain points for projects previously managed, the ending date of the property management role must be no more than 10 years from the application deadline.  In addition, the property  management  experience  with  a  project  shall  not  pre-date  the  project's placed-in-service date.\n- (i) Six  to  10  projects  managed  more  than  three  years,  of  which  two  shall  be California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects 2 points\n- 11  or  more  projects  managed  more  than  three  years,  of  which  two  shall  be California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects 3 points\n\nFor special needs housing type projects only applying through the Nonprofit setaside or Special Needs set-aside only, points are available as described above or as follows:\n\nTwo to three Special Needs projects managed more than three years and one California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project which may or may not be one of the special needs projects 2 points\n\nFour or more Special Needs projects managed more than three years and one California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit project which may or may not be one of the special needs projects 3 points\n\n- (ii)  Management  companies  managing  less  than  two  (2)  active  California  LowIncome Housing Tax Credit projects for more than three years, and management companies for projects requesting points under the special needs categories of subparagraph (i) above and managing no active California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects for more than three years, shall contract with a bona-fide management  company  currently  managing  two  (2)  California  Low  Income Housing Tax Credit projects for more than three years and which itself earns a minimum combined total of two (2) points at the time of application.\n\nWhen contracting with a California-experienced property management company under the terms of paragraph (A)(ii) or (B)(ii) above, the general partner or property co-management entity must obtain training in:  CTCAC ownership/management, project operations, on-site certification training in federal Fair Housing Law, and manager certification in IRS Section 42 program requirements from a CTCAC-approved, nationally recognized entity. Additionally,  the  experienced  property  management  agent  or  an  equally  experienced substitute, must remain for a period of at least three years from the placed-in-service date (or, for ownership transfers, three years from the sale or transfer date) to allow for at least one (1) CTCAC monitoring visit to ensure the project is in compliance with IRC Section 42. Thereafter, the experienced property manager may transfer responsibilities to the remaining general  partner  or  property  management  firm  following  formal  written  approval  from CTCAC.  In applying for and receiving points in these categories, applicants assure that the property shall be owned and managed by entities with equivalent experience scores for the entire 15-year federal compliance and extended use period, pursuant to Section 10320(b). The experience must include at least two (2) Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects in California in service more than three years.\n\nPoints in subsections (A) and (B) above will be awarded in the highest applicable category and  are  not  cumulative.    For  points  to  be  awarded  in  subsection  (B),  an  enforceable management  agreement  executed  by  both  parties  for  the  subject  application  must  be submitted at the time of application.  'Projects' as used in subsections (A) and (B) means multifamily rental affordable developments of over 10 affordable units that are subject to a recorded regulatory agreement, or, in the case of housing on tribal lands, where federal HUD funds  have  been  utilized  in  affordable  rental  developments.  General  Partner  and Management Company experience points may be given based on the experience of the principals involved, or on the experience of municipalities or other nonprofit entities that have experience but have formed single-asset entities for each project in which they have participated, notwithstanding that the entity itself would not otherwise be eligible for such points.  For qualifying experience, 'principal' is defined as an individual overseeing the dayto-day  operations  of  affordable  rental  projects  as  senior  management  personnel  of  the General Partner or property management company.\n\n- (2) Negative points.  Negative points, up to a total of 10 for each project and/or each violation, may be given at the Executive Director's discretion for general partners, co-developers, management agents, consultants, guarantors, or any member or agent of the Development Team as described in Section 10322(h)(5).  Notwithstanding the foregoing and (B) below, failure to meet the requirements of Section 10325(c)(7) shall result in rescission of the Tax Credit  Reservation  or  negative  points.    Negative  points  may  be  assessed  for  items including, but not limited to:\n2. (A) failure to utilize committed public subsidies identified in an application, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the circumstances were entirely outside of the applicant's control;\n\n- (B) failure  to  utilize  Tax  Credits  within  program  time  guidelines  unless  it  can  be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the circumstances were entirely outside of the applicant's control;\n- (C) failure to submit the placed-in-service application by the deadline required in Section 10322(i);\n- (D) removal or withdrawal under threat of removal as general partner from a housing tax credit partnership;\n- (E) failure to provide physical amenities or services or any other item for which points were obtained (unless funding for a specific services program promised is no longer available);\n- (F) failure  to  correct  serious  noncompliance  after  notice  and  cure  period  within  an existing housing tax credit project in California;\n- (G) serious,  after  a  notice  and  cure  period,  or  repeated  failure  to  submit  required compliance documentation for a housing Tax Credit project located anywhere;\n- (H) failure to perform a tenant income recertification upon the first anniversary following the  initial  move-in  certification  for  all  one  hundred  percent  (100%)  tax  credit properties, or failure to conduct ongoing annual income certifications in properties with non-tax-credit units;\n- (I) material misrepresentation of any fact or requirement in an application;\n- (J) failure of a building to continuously meet the terms, conditions, and requirements received at its certification as being suitable for occupancy in compliance with state or local law, unless it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the circumstances were entirely outside the control of the owner;\n- (K) failure to submit a copy of the owner's completed 8609 showing the first year filing;\n- (L) failure to promptly notify CTCAC of a property management change or changing to a management company of lesser experience contrary to Section 10325(c)(1)(B);\n- (M) failure  to  properly  notify  CTCAC  and  obtain  prior  approval  of  Transfer  Events, general partner changes, transfer of a Tax Credit project, or allocation of the Federal or State Credit;\n- (N) certification  of  site  amenities,  distances  or  service  amenities  that  were,  in  the Executive Director's sole discretion, inaccurate or misleading;\n- (O) falsifying documentation of household income or any other materials to fraudulently represent compliance with IRC Section 42; or\n- (P) failure  of  American  Recovery  and  Reinvestment  Act  (ARRA)  funded  projects  to comply with Section 42, CTCAC  regulations, or other applicable  program requirements;\n- (Q) failure to provide required documentation of third-party verification of sustainable and energy efficient features.\n- (R) failure  to  correct  serious  noncompliance,  including  incorrect  rents  or  income qualification,  incorrect  utility  allowance,  or  other  overcharging  of  residents.    In assigning negative points, CTCAC shall consider the most recent monitoring results for  each  of  the  parties'  projects  in  the  most  recent  three-year  monitoring  cycle.\n\nCTCAC  shall  allow  affected  parties  a  reasonable  period  to  correct  serious noncompliance before assigning negative points. Negative points may be warranted when  more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  party's  total  portfolio  has  Level  3 deficiencies under the Uniform Physical Conditions Standards established by HUD. In addition, negative points may be warranted when more than ten percent (10%) of the  tenant  files  most  recently  monitored  resulted  in  findings  of  either  household income above regulated income limits upon initial occupancy, or findings of gross rent exceeding the tax credit maximum limits.\n\n- (S) the  project's  total  eligible  basis  at  placed  in  service  exceeding  the  revised  total adjusted threshold basis limits for the year the project is placed in service by 40%.\n- (T) where CDLAC has determined that a person or entity is subject to negative points under its regulations, CTCAC will deduct an equal amount of points for an equal period of time from tax credit applications involving that person or entity or a Related Party.\n- (U) failure to comply with a requirement of the regulatory agreement or of a covenant entered into 10320(b)(2)(B) or Section 10337(a)(3)(B).\n- (V) submitting  a  check  which  CTCAC,  after  reasonable  efforts  to  correct,  cannot deposit.\n- (W) Final decisions of any local, state, or federal regulatory or investigative body finding violations of the Housing and Accessibility Requirements or Fair Housing Laws.\n\nNegative points given to general partners, co-developers, management agents, consultants, or any other member or agent of the Development Team may remain in effect for up to two calendar years, but in no event will they be in effect for less than one funding round.  Furthermore, they may be assigned to one or more Development Team members, but do not necessarily apply to the entire Team.  Negative points assigned by the Executive Director  may  be  appealed  to  the  Committee  under  appeal  procedures  enumerated  in Section 10330.\n\n- (3) Housing Needs.  (Points will be awarded only in one category listed below except that acquisition and/or rehabilitation Scattered Site Projects may, at the applicant's election, be scored either in the aggregate or proportionately based upon (i) each site's score, and (ii) the percentage of units represented by each site.)  The category selected hereunder (which shall  be  the  category  represented  by  the  highest  percentage  of  Low-Income  Units  in  a proportionally  scored  project)  shall  also  be  the  project  category  for  purposes  of  the  tiebreaker described in subsection 10325(c)(9) below.\n- (4) Amenities beyond those required as additional thresholds\n3. (A) Site Amenities: Site amenities must be appropriate to the tenant population served. To receive points the amenity must be in place at the time of application except as specified in paragraphs 1, 5, and 8 below.  In addition, an amenity to be operated by a public entity that is (i) being constructed within the project as part of the tax credit development, (ii) is receiving development funding for the amenity from the public entity, and (iii) has a proposed operations budget from the operating public entity, would be considered 'in place' at the time of application.  Distances must be measured  using  a  standardized  radius  from  the  development  site  to  the  target\n\nLarge Family Projects Special Needs Projects Seniors Projects At-Risk Projects SRO Projects\n\n10 points\n\n10 points\n\n10 points\n\n10 points\n\n10 points\n\namenity, unless that line crosses a significant physical barrier or barriers.  Such barriers include highways, railroad tracks, regional parks, golf courses, or any other feature  that  significantly  disrupts  the  pedestrian  walking  pattern  between  the development site and the amenity.  The radius line may be struck from the corner of development site nearest the target  amenity,  to  the  nearest  corner  of  the  target amenity site.  However, a radius line shall not be struck from the end of an entry drive or on-site access road that extends from the central portion of the site itself by 250 feet or more.  Rather, the line shall be struck from the nearest corner of the site's central portion.  Where an amenity such as a grocery store resides within a larger shopping complex or commercial strip, the radius line must be measured to the amenity exterior wall, rather than the site boundary.  The resulting distance shall be reduced in such instances by 250 feet to account for close-in parking.\n\nNo more than 15 points will be awarded in this category.  For purposes of the Native American apportionment only, no points will be awarded in this category. However, projects that apply under the Native American apportionment that drop down to the rural set-aside will be scored in this category.  Applicants must certify to the accuracy of their submissions and will be subject to negative points in the round in which an application is considered, as well as subsequent rounds, if the information submitted is found to be inaccurate.  For each amenity, color photographs, a contact person and a contact telephone must be included in the application.  The Committee may employ third parties to verify distances or may have staff verify them.  Only one point award  will  be  available  in  each  of  the  subcategories  (1-9)  listed  below,  with exception of the transit pass option of subcategory 1.  Amenities may include:\n\n## 1.

(For Rural set-aside projects, full points may be awarded where van or dial-a-ride service is  provided  to  tenants,  if  costs  of  obtaining  and  maintaining  the  van  and  its service  are  included  in  the  budget  and  the  operating  schedule  is  either  on demand by tenants or a regular schedule is provided) 4 points\n\nThe site is located within 1/2 mile of a bus rapid transit station, light rail station, commuter rail station, ferry terminal, bus station, or public bus stop. 3 points\n\nIn addition to meeting one of the point categories described above, the applicant commits to provide to residents free transit passes or discounted passes priced\n\nat no more than half of retail cost. Passes shall be made available to each LowIncome Unit at the time a Low-Income Unit is leased to the tenant and shall be made available for at least 15 years. These points are not available for projects with van service. These points are only available to Rural set-aside projects with dial-a-ride service for free or discounted dial-a-ride passes.\n\nAt least one pass per Low-Income Unit\n\n3 points\n\nAt least one pass per each 2 Low-Income Units\n\n2 points\n\n'Light rail station' or 'commuter rail station' or 'ferry terminal' includes a planned rail station or ferry terminal whose construction is programmed into a Regional or State Transportation Improvement Program to be completed within one year of  the  scheduled  completion  and  occupancy  of  the  proposed  residential development.\n\nA private bus or transit system providing service to residents may be substituted for a public system if it (a) meets the relevant headway and distance criteria, and (b) if service is provided free to the residents.  Such private systems must receive approval from the CTCAC Executive Director prior to the application deadline. Multiple bus lines may be aggregated for the above points, only if multiple lines from the designated stop travel to an employment center.  Such aggregation must be demonstrated to, and receive prior approval from, the CTCAC Executive Director in order to receive competitive points.\n\n2. The site is within 1/2 mile of a public park or a community center accessible to the general public (1 mile for Rural set-aside projects).

The site is within 1/2 mile of a full-scale grocery store/supermarket of at least 25,000 gross interior square feet where staples, fresh meat, and fresh produce are  sold  (1  mile  for  Rural  set-aside  projects).    A  large  multi-purpose  store containing a grocery section may garner these points if the application contains the requisite interior measurements of the grocery section of that multipurpose store.    The  'grocery  section'  of  a  large  multipurpose  store  is  defined  as  the portion of the store that sells fresh meat, produce, dairy, baked goods, packaged food products, delicatessen, canned goods, baby foods, frozen foods, sundries, and beverages. 5 points\n\nor within 1 mile (2 miles for Rural set-aside projects) 4 points or within 1.5 miles (3 miles for Rural set-aside projects) 3 points\n\nThe  site  is  within  1/4  mile  of  a  neighborhood  market  of  5,000  gross  interior square feet or more where staples, fresh meat, and fresh produce are sold (1/2 mile  for  Rural  Set-aside  projects).

However, the 'Percent of Low-Income Units' may be used multiple times.  For example, 50% of Low-Income Units at 50% of AMI for 25 points may be combined with another 50% of Low-Income Units at 45% of AMI to achieve the maximum points.  All projects must score at least 45 points in this category to be eligible for 9% Tax Credits.\n\nOnly projects competing in the Rural set aside may use the 55% of AMI column.\n\nProjects electing  the  average  income  federal  set-aside  must  choose targeting  in 10% increments of AMI (i.e. 20% AMI, 30% AMI, 40% AMI, etc.).\n\nLowest Income Points Table (maximum 50 points):\n\n| Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   | Percent of AMI   |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                  |                  | 55%              | 50%              | 45%              | 40%              | 35%              | 30%              | 20%              |\n|                  | 50%              |                  | 25.0*            | 37.5             |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n|                  | 45%              |                  | 22.5*            | 33.8             |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Percent of       | 40%              | 10.0*            | 20.0             | 30.0             |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Low-Income       | 35%              | 8.8*             | 17.5             | 26.3             | 35.0             |                  | 50.0             |                  |\n| Units            | 30%              | 7.5*             | 15.0             | 22.5             | 30.0             | 37.5             | 45.0             |                  |\n|                  | 25%              | 6.3*             | 12.5             | 18.8             | 25.0             | 31.3             | 37.5             | 50.0             |\n|                  | 20%              | 5.0*             | 10.0             | 15.0             | 20.0             | 25.0             | 30.0             | 40.0             |\n|                  | 15%              | 3.8*             | 7.5              | 11.3             | 15.0             | 18.8             | 22.5             | 30.0             |\n|                  | 10%              | 2.5*             | 5.0              | 7.5              | 10.0             | 12.5             | 15.0             | 20.0             |\n\n- *Available to Rural set-aside projects only\n- (B) A project that agrees to have at least ten percent (10%) of its Low-Income Units available  for  tenants  with  incomes  no  greater  than  thirty  percent  (30%)  of  area median, and to restrict the rents on those units accordingly, will receive two points in addition to other points received under this subsection.  The 30% units must be spread across the various bedroom-count units, starting with the largest bedroomcount units (e.g. four bedroom units), and working down to the smaller bedroomcount units, assuring that at least 10% of the larger units are proposed at 30% of AMI.    So  long  as  the  applicant  meets  the  10%  standard  project-wide,  the  10% standard need not be met among all of the smaller units.  The CTCAC Executive Director  may  correct  applicant  errors  in  carrying  out  this  largest-to-smallest  unit protocol.  (These points may be obtained by using the 30% section of the matrix.)\n\nAll projects, except those applying under section 10326 of these regulations, will be subject to  the  minimum low income percentages chosen for a period of 55 years (50 years for projects located on tribal trust land), unless they receive Federal Tax Credits only and are intended  for  eventual  tenant  homeownership,  in  which  case  they  must  submit,  at application, evidence of a financially feasible program, incorporating, among other items, an exit strategy, home ownership counseling, funds to be set aside to assist tenants in the purchase of units, and a plan for conversion of the facility to home ownership at the end of the initial 15 year compliance period.

Within those cities, and for all other applications statewide, the subsequent tiebreakers shall be as follows:\n\nFirst, if an application's housing type goal has been met in the current funding round in the percentages  listed  in  section  10315,  then  the  application  will  be  skipped  (unless  the application  to  be  skipped  is  the  highest  ranked  in  the  set-aside,  Native  American apportionment, or geographic region) if there is another application with the same score and with a housing type goal that has not been met in the current funding round in the percentages listed in section 10315; and\n\nSecond, the highest of the sum of the following:\n\n- (A) Leveraged soft  resources,  as  described  below,  defraying  residential  costs  to  total residential project development costs. Except where a third-party funding commitment is explicitly defraying non-residential costs only, leveraged soft resources shall be discounted by the proportion of the project that is non-residential.  Leveraged soft resources shall be demonstrated through documentation including but not limited to funding award letters, committed land donations, or documented project-specific local fee waivers.\n\nLeveraged soft resources shall include all of the following:\n\n- (i) Public  funds.  'Public  funds'  include  federal,  tribal,  state,  or  local  government funds, including the outstanding principal balances of prior existing public debt or subsidized  debt  that  has  been  or  will  be  assumed  in  the  course  of  an acquisition/rehabilitation  transaction,  except  that  outstanding  principal balances for  projects  subject  to  an  existing  CTCAC  regulatory  agreement  shall  not  be considered public funds if such loans were funded less than 30 years prior to the application deadline. Outstanding principal balances shall not include any accrued interest on assumed loans even where the original interest has been or is being recast  as  principal  under  a  new  loan  agreement.  Public  funds  shall  include assumed  principal  balances  only  upon  documented  approval  of  the  loan assumption  or  other  required  procedure  by  the  public  agency  holding  the promissory note.\n\nIn  addition,  public  funds  include  funds  already  awarded  under  the  Affordable Housing Program of the Federal Home Loan Bank (AHP), waivers resulting in quantifiable  cost  savings  that  are  not  required  by  federal  or  state  law,  local government fee reductions established in ordinance and not required by federal or state law that are available only to rental affordable housing for lower-income households and affordable ownership housing for moderate income households, or the value of land and improvements donated or leased by a public entity or donated as part of an affordable housing ordinance, development agreement or legally  enforceable  mandate  that  is  negotiated  between  a  public  entity  and  an unrelated private developer. The value of land leased by a public entity shall be discounted by the sum of up-front lease pre-payments and all mandatory lease payments in excess of $100 per year over the term of the  lease, exclusive of residual receipt payments. For new construction applications, only the vacant land value  may  be  counted  for  tiebreaker  credit.  The  value  of  improvements  to  be demolished does not qualify as a leveraged soft resource. Private loans that are guaranteed  by  a  public  entity  (for  example,  RHS  Section  538  guaranteed financing)  shall  not  be  counted  as  public  funds,  unless  the  loans  have  a designated  repayment  commitment  from  a  public  source  other  than  rental  or operating subsidies, such as the HUD Title VI Loan Guarantee Program involving\n\nNative  American  Housing  Assistance  and  Self  Determination  Act  (NAHASDA) funds. Land and building values, including for land donated or leased by a public entity  or  donated  as  part  of  an  affordable  housing  ordinance,  development agreement or legally enforceable mandate, must be supported by an independent, third-party  appraisal  consistent  with  the  guidelines  in  Section  10322(h)(9).  The appraised value is not to include off-site improvements. For Tribal apportionment applications, donated land value and land-purchase funding shall not be eligible. However, unsuccessful Tribal apportionment applicants subsequently competing within the rural set-aside or tribal applicants competing in a geographic region shall have such donated land value and land-purchase funding counted competitively as  public  funding  if  the  land  value  is  established  in  accordance  with  the requirements of this paragraph.\n\nLoans must be 'soft' loans, having terms (or remaining terms) of at least 15 years, and below market interest rates and interest accruals, and are either fully deferred or require only residual receipts payments for at least the first fifteen years of their terms.  Qualified  soft  loans  may  have  annual  fees  that  reasonably  defray compliance monitoring and asset management costs associated with the project. The maximum below-market interest rate allowed for tiebreaker purposes shall be the  greater  of  four  percent  (4%)  simple,  or  the  Applicable  Federal  Rate  if compounding. RHS Section 514 or 515 financing shall be considered soft debt in spite of a debt service requirement. Further, there shall be conclusive evidence presented that any new public funds have been firmly committed to the proposed project and require no further approvals, and that there has been no consideration other than the proposed housing given by anyone connected to the project, for the funds or the donated or leased land. Seller carryback financing and any portion of a  loan  from  a  public  seller  or  related  party  that  is  less  than  or  equal  to  sale proceeds due the seller, except for a public land loan to a new construction project that  is  not  replacing  affordable  housing  within  the  footprint  of  the  original development,  shall  be  excluded  for  purposes  of  the  tiebreaker.  Projects  that include both new construction and rehabilitation or affordable housing replacement shall have the land loan value prorated based on units.\n\nPublic contributions of off-site costs shall not be counted competitively, unless (1) documented  as  a  waived  fee  pursuant  to  a  nexus  study  and  relevant  State Government Code provisions regulating such fees or (2) the off-sites  must  be developed by the sponsor as a condition  of  local  approval  and  those  off-sites consist solely of utility connections, and curbs, gutters, and sidewalks immediately bordering  the  property.    Public  funds  shall  be  reduced  for  tie  breaker  scoring purposes by an amount equal to the off-sites not meeting the requirements noted in this paragraph.\n\nThe  capitalized  value  of  rent  differentials  attributable  to  public  rent  or  public operating  subsidies  shall  be  considered  public  funds  based  upon  CTCAC underwriting standards. Standards shall include a 15-year loan term; an interest rate established annually by CTCAC based upon a spread over 10-year Treasury Bill rates; a 1.15 to 1 debt service coverage ratio; and a five percent (5%) vacancy rate.  In  addition,  the  rental  income  differential  for  subsidized  units  shall  be established by subtracting tax credit rental income at 40 percent (40%) AMI levels (30%  AMI  for  units  subject  to  the  40%  average  AMI  requirement  of  Section 10325(g)(3)(A))  from  the  committed  contract  rent  income  documented  by  the subsidy source or, in the case of a USDA rental subsidy only, the higher of 60% AMI rents or the committed contract USDA Basic rents.  The committed contract rent income for units with existing project-based Section 8 rental subsidy shall be documented  by  the  current  monthly  contract  rent  in  place  at  the  time  of  the\n\napplication or by contract rent committed to and approved by the subsidy source (HUD); rent from a rent comparable study or post-rehabilitation rent shall not be permitted.  The rent differential for projects with public operating subsidies shall equal the annual subsidy amount in year 1, provided the subsidy will be of a similar amount in succeeding years, or the aggregate subsidy amount of the contract divided by the number of years in the contract if the contract does not specify an annual subsidy amount.\n\n- (ii)  soft loans that meet the criteria described in subparagraph (i) (except that terms shall be of at least 55 years), or grants, from unrelated non-public parties that are not  covered  by  subparagraph  (i)  and  that  do  not  represent  financing  available through the National Mortgage Settlement Affordable Rental Housing Consumer Relief programs. The party providing the soft loans or grants shall not be a partner or  proposed  partner  in  the  limited  partnership  (unless  the  partner  has  no ownership  interest  and  only  the  right  to  complete  construction)  and  shall  not receive any benefit or funds from a related party to the project. The application shall include (1) a certification from an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or independent tax attorney that the leveraged soft resource(s) is from an unrelated non-public entity(ies), that the unrelated non-public entity(ies) shall not receive  any  benefit  or  funds  from  a  related  party  to  the  project,  and  that  the leveraged soft resource(s) is available and not committed to any other project or use; and (2) a narrative from the applicant regarding the nature and source of the leveraged soft resource(s) and the conditions under which it was given. Seller carryback financing and any portion of a loan from a non-public seller or related party that is less than or equal to sale proceeds due the seller shall be excluded for purposes of the tiebreaker.\n- (iii) the value of donated land and improvements that are not covered by subparagraph (i), that meet the criteria described in subparagraph (i), and that are contributed by an unrelated entity (unless otherwise approved by the Executive Director), so long as the contributed asset has been held by the entity for at least five years prior to the application due date, except for the value of donated land and improvements in the case of a rehabilitation project subject to an existing regulatory agreement with CTCAC or a federal, state, or local public entity or with greater than 25% of the units receiving project-based rental assistance unless the land and improvements are wholly donated. For a case in which the donor is a non-profit  organization  acting  solely  as  a  pass-through  entity,  the  Executive Director may in advance of the application date approve an exception to the fiveyear  hold  rule  provided  that  the  donor  to  the  non-profit  organization  held  the contributed asset for at least five years and that both the original donor and nonprofit  donor  meet  the  requirements  of,  and  are  included  in  the  certifications required by, this paragraph. The party providing the donation shall not be a partner or  proposed  partner  in  the  limited  partnership  (unless  the  partner  has  no ownership  interest  and  only  the  right  to  complete  construction)  and  shall  not receive any benefit from a related party to the project. In addition, the land shall not  have  been  owned  previously  by  a  related  party  or  a  partner  or  proposed partner  (unless  the  partner  has  no  ownership  interest  and  only  the  right  to complete  construction).  The  application  shall  include  a  certification  from  an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or independent tax attorney that the  donation  is  from  an  unrelated  entity  and  that  the  unrelated  entity  shall  not receive  any  benefit  from  a  related  party  to  the  project.  For  new  construction applications, only the vacant land value may be counted for tiebreaker credit. The value  of  improvements  to  be  demolished  does  not  qualify  as  a  leveraged  soft resource.\n\n- (iv) For  purposes  of  this  section,  a  related  party  shall  mean  a  member  of  the development team or a Related Party, as defined in Section 10302, to a member of the development team.\n- (v)  For 4% credit applications, recycled private activity bonds (whether they be used for  construction or permanent financing or both) shall be considered leveraged soft resources so long as the loan terms are consistent with market standards.\n\nPermanent funding sources for this tiebreaker shall not include equity commitments related to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.\n\nLand donations include land leased for a de minimis annual lease payment. CTCAC may  contract  with  an  appraisal  reviewer  and,  if  it  does  so,  shall  commission  an appraisal  review  for  donated  land  and  improvements  if  a  reduction  of  15%  to  the submitted appraisal value would change an award outcome. If the appraisal review finds the submitted appraisal to be inappropriate, misleading, or inconsistent with the data  reported  and  with  other  generally  known  information,  then  the  reviewer  shall develop  their  own  opinion  of  value  and  CTCAC  shall  use  the  opinion  of  value established by the appraisal reviewer for calculating the tiebreaker only.\n\nThe numerator of projects of 50 or more newly constructed or adaptive reuse Tax Credit Units shall be multiplied by a size factor equal to seventy five percent plus the total number of newly constructed or adaptively reused Tax Credit Units divided by 200  (75%  +  (total  new  construction/adaptive  reuse  units/200)).  The  size  factor calculation shall be limited to no more than 150 Tax Credit Units.\n\nIn the case of a new construction Hybrid 9% and 4% tax credit development which meets  all  of  the  following  conditions,  the  calculation  of  the  size  factor  for  the  9% application shall include all of the Tax Credit Units in the 4% application up to the limit described  above,  the  leveraged  soft  resources  ratio  calculated  pursuant  to  this subparagraph  (A)  shall  utilize  the  combined  amount  of  leveraged  soft  resources defraying  residential  costs  and  the  combined  total  residential  project  development costs from both the 9% and 4% applications, and the ratio calculated pursuant to subparagraph (B) shall also utilize the combined total residential project development costs from both the 9% and 4% applications:\n\n- (i)  the 4% application shall have been submitted to CTCAC and CDLAC by the 9% application deadline;\n- (ii)  the  4%  and  9%  projects  are  simultaneous  phases,  as  defined  in  Section 10327(c)(2)(C);\n- (iii) the 4% application is eligible for maximum points under Sections 10325(c)(3), (4)(B),  (5),  and  (6),  except  that  1)  the  4%  application  may  be  eligible  for maximum points in the lowest income category in combination with the 9% project, and 2) the 4% application may be eligible for maximum housing type points  in  combination  with  the  9%  project.  Under  each  exception,  the  9% project shall also be scored in the corresponding point category in combination with the 4% project; and\n- (iv) developers shall defer or contribute as equity to the project any amount of combined 4% and 9% developer fees in cost that are in excess of the limit pursuant to Section 10327(c)(2)(A) plus $20,000 per unit for each Tax Credit Unit in excess of 100, using (a) the combined Tax Credit Units of the 9% and 4%  components,  (b)  the  combined  eligible  basis  of  the  9%  and  4% components, and (c) the high-cost test factor calculated using the eligible basis and threshold basis limits for the 9% component.\n\nIn the event that the 4% component of a Hybrid project that receives an increase to its size factor pursuant to this paragraph is not placed in service within six months of the 9% component, both applicants may be subject to negative points.\n\nIf  the  project's  paid  purchase  price  exceeds  appraised  value,  the  leveraged  soft resources amount shall be discounted by the overage, unless the Executive Director has granted a waiver pursuant to Section 10327(c)(6).\n\n- (B) One (1)  minus  the  ratio  of  requested  unadjusted  eligible  basis  to  total  residential project development costs, with the resulting figure divided by two.\n- (C) Except  as  provided  below,  a  new  construction  Large  Family  housing  type  project (excluding a Special Needs project with non-special needs Low-Income Units meeting Large Family housing type requirements) shall receive a higher resource area bonus as  follows  based  on  the  designation  of  the  project's  location  on  the  CTCAC/HCD Opportunity Area Map:\n\nThe project is non-rural and the project's census tract is a Highest Resource area 20 percentage points\n\nThe project is non-rural and the project's census tract is a High Resource area 10 percentage points\n\nThe project is rural and project's census tract or census block group as applicable is a Highest Resource area 10 percentage points\n\nThe project is rural and the project's census tract or census block group as applicable is a High Resource area 5 percentage points\n\nThis bonus shall not apply to projects once the housing type goal for Large Family New Construction receiving the tiebreaker increase has been met in a round or within the  Rural  set  aside  in  a  round  as  described  in  Section  10315(h)  and  Section 10325(c)(9).\n\nThis bonus shall not apply to projects competing in the Native American apportionment,  unless  such  projects  fall  into  the  rural  set-aside  competition.  In addition,  this  bonus  shall  not  apply  to  a  project  supported  by  affordable  housing ordinances, which for purposes of this subparagraph shall mean a project in which any  of  the  Low-Income  Units  satisfy  the  obligations  of  any  affordable  housing ordinance,  development  agreement  or  legally  enforceable  mandate  negotiated between a public entity and private developer, unless the obligations derive solely from the Low-Income Units themselves or unless the project includes at least 40 LowIncome Units that are not counted towards the obligations of the affordable housing ordinance, development agreement, or legally enforceable mandate. An application for a large family new construction project located in a High or Highest Resource area shall disclose whether or not the project includes any Low-Income Units which satisfy the obligations of an affordable housing ordinance, development agreement or legally enforceable mandate and, if so, the number of such units and whether the affordable obligations derive solely from the Low-Income Units themselves.\n\nAn  applicant  may  choose  to  utilize  the  census  tract,  or  census  block  group  as applicable, resource designation from the CTCAC/HCD Opportunity Maps in effect when the initial  site  control  was  obtained  up  to  seven  calendar  years  prior  to  the application.\n\n- (D) For Rural set aside projects applying in counties where no tax credit applications have been received within five years of the application filing date, the tiebreaker shall be increased by five percentage points.\n\nThe resulting tiebreaker score must not have decreased following award or negative points may be awarded.\n\n- (d) Application selection for evaluation.  Except where CTCAC staff determines a project to be high cost, staff shall score and rank projects as described below. Staff shall identify high-cost projects by comparing each scored project's total eligible basis against its total adjusted threshold basis limits.  CTCAC  shall  calculate  total  eligible  basis  by  using  all  project  costs  listed  within  the application unless those costs are not includable in basis under federal law as demonstrated by the  shaded  cells  in  the  application  sources  and  uses  budget  itself  or  by  a  letter  from  the development  team's  third-party  tax  professional.  A  project  will  be  designated  'high  cost'  if  a project's total eligible basis exceeds its total adjusted threshold basis limit by 30%. Staff shall not recommend such project for credits.  Any project that receives a reservation on or after January 1, 2016 may be subject to negative points if the project's total  eligible  basis  at  placed  in  service exceeds the revised total adjusted threshold basis limit by 40%. For purposes of calculating the high-cost test at placed in service, CTCAC shall use the higher of the unadjusted threshold basis limit from application or the year the project places in services.\n\nFollowing the scoring and ranking of project applications in accordance with the above criteria, subject to conditions described in these regulations, reservations of Tax Credits shall be made for those applications of highest rank in the following manner.\n\n- (1) Set-aside  application  selection.    Beginning  with  the  top-ranked  application  from  the Nonprofit set-aside, followed by the Rural set-aside (funding the RHS, HOME, and CDBGDR program apportionment first, and the Native American apportionment second), the AtRisk set-aside, and the Special Needs set-aside, the highest scoring applications will have Tax Credits reserved.  Credit amounts to be reserved in the set-asides will be established at the exact percentages set forth in section 10315, with the exception of the Federal Credit amount  established  by  the  Further  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act,  2020  and  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.  If the last project funded in a set-aside requires more than the credits remaining in that set-aside, such overages in the first funding round will be subtracted from that set-aside in determining the amount available in the set-aside for the second funding round.  If Credits are not reserved in the first round, they will be added to second round amounts in the same Set Aside.  If more Tax Credits are reserved to  the  last  project  in  a  set-aside  than  are  available  in  that  set-aside  during  the  second funding  round,  the  overage  will  be  taken  from  the  Supplemental  Set-Aside  if  there  are sufficient funds.  If not, the award will be counted against the amounts available from the geographic area in which the project is located.  Any unused credits from any Set-Asides will be transferred to the Supplemental Set-Aside and used for Waiting List projects after the second round.  Tax Credits reserved in all set-asides shall be counted within the housing type goals.\n2. (A) For an application to receive a reservation within a set-aside, or within a rural setaside apportionment, there shall be at least one dollar of Credit not yet reserved in the set-aside or apportionment.\n3. (B) Set-aside applications requesting State tax credits shall be funded, even when State credits for that year have been exhausted.  The necessary State credits shall be reserved from the subsequent year's aggregate annual State credit allotment.\n4. (C) Except for projects competing in the rural set-aside, which shall not be eligible to compete in geographic area, unless the projects are located within a Geographic Region and no other projects have been funded within the Project's region during\n\nthe  year  in  question,  after  a  set-aside  is  reserved,  all  remaining  applications competing within the set-aside shall compete in the Geographic Region.\n\nFederal  Credit  established  by  the  FCAA  application  selection.  Applications  for  projects located in the counties designated as qualified 2017 and 2018 California disaster areas by the FCAA, FCAA Federal Credit shall only be reserved for (1) new construction projects also including projects that involve the demolition or rehabilitation of existing residential units that increase the unit count by (i) 25 or (ii) 50% of the existing units, whichever is greater,  and  adaptive  re-use  of  non-residential  structures,  or  (2)  reconstruction  or rehabilitation of an existing project located within a FCAA disaster area fire perimeter, as designated by CAL FIRE and available on the CTCAC website https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/, and directly damaged by the fire, and that apply for the FCAA Federal Credit. Applications shall meet all program eligibility requirements unless stated otherwise below, and located in the following counties: Butte, Lake, Los Angeles, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Orange, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Shasta, Sonoma, Ventura, and Yuba.\n\nApplications for projects applying for FCAA Federal Credit shall be competitively scored within  the  county  apportionment  under  the  system  delineated  in  Sections  10325(c)(1) through (3), (4)(B), and (6). In the cases where applications receive the same score, the following  tiebreakers  shall  be  employed:  First,  a  formal  letter  of  support  for  the  specific project from the Local Reviewing Agency (LRA) outlining how the project will contribute to the community's recovery efforts submitted in the application or received by CTCAC no later than  14  days  following  the  application  filing  deadline;  Second,  the  application  with  the greatest  number  of  proposed  Tax  Credit  Units  per  annual  Federal  Tax  Credit  amount requested; and Third, the application with the greatest number of proposed bedrooms within the proposed Tax Credit Units.\n\nFor projects located within a FCAA disaster area fire perimeter, as designated by CAL FIRE and  available  on  the  CTCAC  website  https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/,  applying  for FCAA Federal Credit in the 2020 funding round, local approvals and zoning requirements of Section 10325(f)(4) must be evidenced to CTCAC no later than June 1, 2021. Failure to do so shall result in rescission of the Tax Credit Reservation on June 2, 2021. The deadline in this paragraph may be extended if the Executive Director finds, in their sole discretion, a project merits additional time due to delays directly caused by fire, war, or act of God. In considering a request, the Executive Director may consider, among other things, the length of the delay and the circumstances relating to the delay.\n\nThe  deferred-payment  financing  commitment  requirements  of  Section  10325(f)(8)  are modified  for  FCAA  Federal  Credit  applications  with  2017  and  2018  HCD  Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Multifamily financing as follows: a letter  from  an  HCD identified jurisdiction  stating  the  intent  to  commit  a  portion  of  that jurisdiction's HCD allocation. The letter must provide the dollar amount and the estimated date which the jurisdiction will provide CTCAC a written commitment in compliance with the requirements of Section 10325(f)(8). Projects must receive these CDBG-DR funds prior to the CTCAC placed-in service application deadline.\n\nFCAA Federal Credit shall be made available starting in the 2020 second funding round in the amounts shown below:\n\n| ANNUAL FEDERAL TAX CREDIT BASE + LOST UNIT ALLOCATION   | COUNTY   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| $40,087,453                                             | Butte    |\n| $16,365,940                                             | Sonoma   |\n\n| $5,630,499   | Los Angeles   |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| $5,421,263   | Shasta        |\n| $4,975,965   | Ventura       |\n| $4,109,511   | Napa          |\n| $3,342,311   | Mendocino     |\n| $3,259,153   | Lake          |\n| $2,886,283   | Yuba          |\n| $2,816,537   | San Diego     |\n| $2,583,158   | Santa Barbara |\n| $2,580,476   | Nevada        |\n| $2,561,698   | Orange        |\n| $2,000,000   | Supplemental  |\n| $98,620,247  | TOTAL         |\n\nThe funding order shall be followed by funding the highest scoring application, if any, in each of the 13 counties. After each county has had the opportunity to fund one project, CTCAC shall award the second highest scoring project in each county, if any, and continue cycling through the counties, filling each county's apportionment.\n\nFor an application to receive a FCAA Federal Credit reservation, there shall be at least one dollar of Credit not yet reserved in the county allocation so long as the county's last award does not cause the county's aggregate award amount to exceed 105 percent (105%) of the amount originally available for that county. FCAA Federal Credit allocated in excess of the county's allocation by the application of the 105% rule described above will be deducted from the Supplemental allocation. If the last application requires credits in excess of 105% of the county's allocation, that application will not be funded. If all FCAA Federal Credit in a funding round has been awarded, all remaining FCAA applications shall compete in the applicable set-aside or geographic region, provided the application meets the requirements of the set-aside or geographic region, and the requirements of Section 10325.\n\nAt the conclusion of the funding round, if less than 10% of the total FCAA Federal Credit remains, all unallocated FCAA Federal Credit within the county allocations will be combined and available to remaining projects requesting FCAA Federal Credits, and which meet the threshold and underwriting requirements through a waiting list. The award selection will be made from the waiting list to the counties in the order listed above.  Within each county, the award selection will start with the highest-ranking project located within a FCAA disaster area  fire  perimeter,  as  designated  by  CAL  FIRE  and  available  on  the  CTCAC  website https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/ first and continue within that county in rank order until no eligible applications remain. Subsequent to the above selection ranking, any unused FCAA Federal Credit shall be designated for projects where at least fifty percent (50%) of the  Low-Income  Units  within  the  project  are  designated  for  homeless  households  as described  in  Sections  10315(b)(1)  through  (4)  starting  with  the  highest-ranking  project pursuant to Section 10325(c) without regard to the set aside or geographic region for which the application applied.\n\nAll  projects  awarded  FCAA  Federal  Credit  in  2020  may  return  their  allocation  to  the Committee without assessment of negative points if the formal written notification from the\n\napplicant of the return is received by the Committee no later than September 1, 2021. Any returned credits following September 1, 2021 will be made available to projects from the FCAA Federal Credit waiting list as previously stated. Any new application received for a project on the waiting list shall result in that project's removal from the waiting list.\n\nThe FCAA Federal Credit amount shall not be counted towards the set asides of Section 10315, the housing type goals of Section 10315(h), or the geographic apportionments of Section 10315(i). Applications for FCAA Federal Credit shall not be counted towards the four  (4)  awards  limit  of  Section  10325(c).  Notwithstanding  Section  10325(f)(9)(C),  the maximum annual Federal Tax Credits available for award to any one project in any funding round applying for FCAA Federal Credit shall not exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Applications for FCAA Federal Credit are not eligible for State Tax Credits.\n\nFederal  Credit  established  by  the  CAA  application  selection.  Applications  for  projects located in the counties designated as qualified 2020 California disaster areas by the CAA, CAA Federal Credit shall only be reserved for (1) new construction projects also including projects that involve the demolition or rehabilitation of existing residential units that increase the unit count by (i) 25 or (ii) 50% of the existing units, whichever is greater, and adaptive re-use  of  nonresidential  structures,  or  (2)  reconstruction  or  rehabilitation  of  an  existing project located within a CAA or FCAA disaster area fire perimeter, as designated by CAL FIRE and available on the CTCAC website https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/, and directly damaged by the fire, and that apply for the CAA Federal Credit. Applications shall meet all program eligibility requirements unless stated otherwise below, and located in the following counties: Butte, Fresno, Lake, Lassen, Los Angeles, Madera, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, San  Bernardino,  San  Diego,  San  Mateo,  Santa  Clara,  Santa  Cruz,  Shasta,  Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Trinity, Tulare, and Yolo.\n\nApplications  for  projects  applying  for  CAA  Federal  Credit  shall  be  competitively  scored within  the  county/regional  apportionment  under  the  system  delineated  in  Sections 10325(c)(1) through (8). At the sole discretion of the Executive Director, an extension of up to  90  days may be granted to the 180/194-day readiness deadline. In the cases where applications  receive  the  same  score,  the  following  tiebreakers  shall  be  employed:  First, projects located within a CAA or FCAA disaster area fire perimeter, as designated by CAL FIRE and available on the CTCAC website https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/, and not opposed or strongly opposed by the Local Reviewing Agency (LRA); Second, the presence of an enforceable financing commitment to the specific project of at least $1,000,000 from HCD and assuming a 4% tax credit financing structure such that the Federal Tax Credit request divided by the total eligible basis does not exceed 7.5%; and Third, the application with  the  greatest  number  of  proposed  bedroom-adjusted  Tax  Credit  Units  per  annual Federal Tax Credit amount requested. To calculate the bedroom-adjusted units, each Tax Credit Unit will be multiplied by the adjustment factor for units of that bedroom count. A project's adjusted units shall be the sum of each of these products. The adjustment factors shall be:\n\n- .9 for a studio unit.\n- 1.25 for a two-bedroom unit.\n- 1 for a one-bedroom unit.\n- 1.5 for a three-bedroom unit up to no more than 30% of the total units, then such additional units shall be counted as 2-bedroom units.\n- 1.75 for a four-bedroom or larger unit up to no more than 10% of the total units, then such additional units shall be counted as 2-bedroom units.\n\nThe  deferred-payment  financing  commitment  requirements  of  Section  10325(f)(8)  are modified for  CAA Federal Credit applications with HCD Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) Multifamily financing as follows: a letter from an HCD identified jurisdiction stating the intent to commit a portion of that jurisdiction's HCD allocation.  The  letter  must  provide  the  dollar  amount  and  the  estimated  date  which  the jurisdiction will provide CTCAC a written commitment in compliance with the requirements\n\nof Section 10325(f)(8). Projects must receive these CDBG-DR funds prior to the CTCAC placed-in service application deadline. CAA Federal Credit shall be made available starting in the 2021 second funding round in the amounts shown below:\n\n| ANNUAL FEDERAL TAX CREDIT BASE + LOST UNIT ALLOCATION   | COUNTY/ REGION                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $17,261,698                                             | Butte County                                                                                 |\n| $12,058,293                                             | Santa Cruz County                                                                            |\n| $9,395,477                                              | Napa County                                                                                  |\n| $8,714,494                                              | North Region (San Mateo, Santa Clara, Shasta, Solano, Stanislaus, and Yolo Counties)         |\n| $8,609,728                                              | Fresno County                                                                                |\n| $8,408,925                                              | Sonoma County                                                                                |\n| $7,553,332                                              | South Region (Madera, Monterey, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Tulare Counties) |\n| $6,741,391                                              | Rural (Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Siskiyou, and Trinity Counties)                              |\n| $2,000,000                                              | Supplemental                                                                                 |\n| $80,743,338                                             | TOTAL                                                                                        |\n\nThe  funding  order  shall  start  with  applications  selected  in  rank  order  within  each county/region  in  the  order  above.  For  an  application  to  receive  a  CAA  Federal  Credit reservation, there shall be at least one dollar of Credit not yet reserved in the county/region allocation  so  long  as  the  county/region's  last  award  does  not  cause  the  county/region aggregate award amount to exceed 105 percent (105%) of the amount originally available for  that  county/region.  CAA  Federal  Credit  allocated  in  excess  of  the  county/region's allocation by the application of the 105% rule described above will be deducted from the Supplemental allocation. If the last application selected requires credits in excess of 105% of the county/region's allocation, that application will not be funded. Any CAA Federal Credit remaining in a county/region apportionment at the end of a funding round will be available in the subsequent round. For the final funding round of 2022 for CAA Federal Credits, if the aggregate amount of Federal Credit requested does not exceed the amount available, the 105% county limit above shall not apply. If all CAA Federal Credit in a funding round has been awarded, all remaining CAA applications shall compete in the applicable set-aside or geographic region,  provided  the  application  meets  the  requirements  of  the  set-aside  or geographic region, and the requirements of Section 10325.\n\nAt the conclusion of the funding round, if less than 10% of the total CAA Federal Credit remains, all  unallocated  CAA  Federal  Credit  within  the  county/region  allocations  will  be combined and available to remaining projects requesting CAA Federal Credits, and which meet  the  threshold  and  underwriting  requirements  through  a  waiting  list.  The  award selection will be made from the waiting list to the counties in order number of lost homes highest to lowest. Within each county, the award selection will start with the highest-ranking project located within a CAA or FCAA disaster area fire perimeter, as designated by CAL FIRE and available on the CTCAC website https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/ first  and continue within that county in rank order until no eligible applications remain.\n\nThe CAA Federal Credit amount shall not be counted towards the set asides of Section 10315, the housing type goals of Section 10315(h), or the geographic apportionments of Section 10315(i). Applications for CAA Federal Credit shall not be counted towards the four (4) awards limit of Section 10325(c). Notwithstanding Section 10325(f)(9)(C), the maximum annual Federal Tax Credits available for award to any one project in any funding round applying  for  CAA  Federal  Credit  shall  not  exceed  Four  Million  Dollars  ($4,000,000). Applications for CAA Federal Credit are not eligible for State Tax Credits.\n\n- (2) Geographic Areas selection.  Tax Credits remaining following reservations to all set-asides shall be reserved to projects within the geographic areas, beginning with the geographic area having the smallest apportionment, and proceeding upward according to size in the first funding round and in reverse order in the second funding round. The funding order shall be followed by funding the highest scoring application, if any, in each of the regions.  After each region has had the opportunity to fund one project, CTCAC shall award the second highest scoring project in each region, if any, and continue cycling through the regions, filling each geographic area's apportionment.  Projects will be funded in order of their rank so long as the region's aggregate award amount does not exceed 125 percent (125%) of the amount originally available for that region in that funding round.  Credits allocated in excess of the Geographic Apportionments by the application of the 125% rule described above will be drawn from the second-round apportionments during the first round, and from the Supplemental Set Aside during the second round. However, all Credits drawn from the Supplemental Set Aside will be deducted from the Apportionment in the subsequent round.\n\nWhen the highest-ranking project or next highest-ranking project(s) do not meet the 125% rule then the Committee shall skip over that project to fund a project requesting a smaller credit  award that does not exceed the 125% requirement. However, no project may be funded by this skipping process unless it (a) has a point score equal to that of the first project skipped,  and  (b)  has  a  final  tiebreaker  score  equal  to  at  least  75%  of  the  first  skipped project's final tiebreaker score.\n\nTo the extent that there is a positive balance remaining in a geographic area after a funding round, such amount will be added to the amount available in that geographic area in the subsequent funding round.  Similarly, to the extent that there is a deficit in a geographic area after a funding round, such amount will be subtracted from the funds available for reservation in the next funding round.  Any unused credit from the geographic areas in the second funding round will be added back into the Supplemental Set-Aside.   Tax credits reserved in all geographic areas shall be counted within the housing type goals.\n\n- (e) Application Evaluation.  To receive a reservation of Tax Credits, applications selected pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, shall be evaluated, pursuant to IRC Section 42, H &amp; S Code Sections 50199.4  through  50199.22,  R  &amp;  T  Code  Sections  12206,  17058,  and  23610.5,  and  these regulations to determine if; eligible, by meeting all program eligibility requirements; complete, which includes meeting all basic threshold and additional threshold requirements; and financially feasible. In scoring and evaluating project applications, the Executive Director shall have the discretion to interpret  the  intent  of  these  regulations  and  to  score  and  evaluate  applications  accordingly. Applicants understand that there is no 'right' to receive Tax Credits under these regulations.  The Committee shall make available to the general public a written explanation for any allocation of Tax Credits that is not made in accordance with the established priorities and selection criteria of these Regulations.\n- (f) Basic  Thresholds.    No  application  is  complete  without  meeting  the  following  basic  threshold requirements at the time the application is filed and to the Executive Director's satisfaction:\n- (1) Housing need and demand.  Applicants shall provide evidence that the type of housing proposed,  including  proposed  rent  levels,  is  needed  and  affordable  to  the  targeted population within the community in which it is located, with evidence including a market study that meets the current market study guidelines distributed by the Committee.  Market studies will be assessed thoroughly. Meeting the requirements of subsection (B) below is\n\nessential, but because other elements of the market study will also be considered, meeting those requirements in subsection (B) will not in itself show adequate need and demand for a proposed project or ensure approval of a given project.  Evidence shall be conclusive and include the most recent documentation available (prepared or updated within 180 days of the application date).  Evidence of housing need and demand shall include, but is not limited to:\n\n- (A) evidence  of  public  housing  waiting  lists,  by  bedroom  size  and  tenant  type,  if available, from the local housing authority; and\n- (B) except as provided in Section 10322(h)(10), a market study as described in Section 10322(h)(10) of these regulations, which provides evidence that:\n- (i) The proposed tenant paid rents for each affordable unit type in the proposed development will be at least ten percent (10%) below the weighted average rent for the same unit types in comparable market rate rental properties;\n- (ii)  Except for special needs rehabilitation projects in which at least 90% of the total units are SRO units, the proposed unit value ratio stated as dollars per square foot  ($/s.f.)  will  be  no  more  than  the  weighted  average  unit  value  ratios  for comparable market rate units;\n- (iii) In  rural  areas  without  sufficient  three-  and  four-bedroom  market  rate  rental comparables, the market study must show that in comparison to three- and fourbedroom market rate single family homes, the affordable rents will be at least 20% below the rents for single family homes and the $/s.f. ratio will not exceed that of the single family homes; and\n- (iv) The  demand  for  the  proposed  project's  units  must  appear  strong  enough  to reach stabilized occupancy - 90% occupancy for Special Needs projects and 95% for all  other  projects  -  within  six  months  of  being  placed  in  service  for projects of 150 units or less, and within 12 months for projects of more than 150 units and senior projects.\n- (2) Demonstrated site control.  Applicants shall provide evidence that the subject property is within the control of the applicant.\n- (A) Site control may be evidenced by:\n- (i) a current title report (within 90 days of application except as provided in Section 10322(h)(35) (or preliminary title report, but not title insurance or commitment to insure) showing the applicant holds fee title or, for tribal trust land, a title status report or an attorney's opinion regarding chain of title and current title status;\n- (ii) an executed lease agreement or lease option for the length of time the project will be regulated under this program connecting the applicant and the owner of the subject property;\n- (iii) an executed disposition and development agreement connecting the applicant and a public agency; or,\n- (iv) a valid, current, enforceable contingent purchase and sale agreement or option agreement connecting the applicant and the owner of the subject property. Evidence must be provided at the time of the application that all extensions and other  conditions  necessary  to  keep  the  agreement  current  through  the application filing deadline have been executed.\n\n- (B) A current title report (within 90 days of application except as provided in Section 10322(h)(35) (or preliminary title report, but not title insurance or commitment to insure) or for tribal trust land a title status report or an attorney's opinion regarding chain  of  title  and  current  title  status,  shall  be  submitted  with  all  applications  for purposes of this threshold requirement.\n- (C) The Executive Director may determine, in her/his sole discretion, that site control has  been  demonstrated  where  a  local  agency  has  demonstrated  its  intention  to acquire the site, or portion of the site, through eminent domain proceedings.\n- (3) Enforceable  financing  commitment.    Applicants  shall  provide  evidence  of  enforceable financing commitments for at least fifty percent (50%) of the acquisition and construction financing,  or  at  least  fifty  percent  (50%)  of  the  permanent  financing,  of  the  proposed project's estimated  total acquisition and  construction or total  permanent  financing requirements. An 'enforceable financing commitment' must:\n- (A) be in writing, stating rate and terms, and in the form of a loan, grant or an approval of the assignment/assumption of existing debt by the mortgagee;\n- (B) be subject only to conditions within the control of the applicant, but for obtaining other financing sources including an award of Tax Credits;\n- (C) have a term of at least fifteen (15) years if it is permanent financing;\n- (D) demonstrate feasibility for fifteen (15) years at the underwriting interest rate, if it is a variable or adjustable interest rate permanent loan; and,\n- (E) be  executed by a lender other than a mortgage broker, the applicant, or an entity with  an  identity  of  interest  with  the  applicant,  unless  the  applicant  is  a  lending institution actively and regularly engaged in residential lending; and\n- (F) be accepted in writing by the proposed mortgagor or grantee, if private financing.\n\nSubstitution of such funds after a Reservation of Tax Credits may be permitted only when the source of funding is similar to that of the original funding, for example, use of a bank loan to substitute for another bank loan, or public funds for other public funds. General Partner loans or developer loans must be accompanied by documented proof of funds being available at the time of application.  In addition, General Partner or developer loans to the project are unique and may not be substituted for or foregone if committed to within the application.    After  a  Reservation  of  Tax  Credits  an  applicant  may  substitute  Affordable Housing Program (AHP) funds provided pursuant to a program of the Federal Home Loan Bank for any other source.\n\nProjects awarded under a Nonprofit set-aside homeless assistance priority or a Rural setaside RHS, HOME, or CDBG-DR apportionment pursuant to a funding commitment may not substitute other funds for this commitment after application to CTCAC. Failure to retain the funding may result in an award of negative points.\n\nFor  projects  using  FHA-insured  debt,  the  submission  of  a  letter  from  a  Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) lender stating that they have underwritten the project and that it  meets the requirements for submittal of a multifamily accelerated processing firm commitment application to HUD.\n\n- (4) Local approvals and Zoning.\n2. (A) Applicants shall provide evidence, at the time the application is filed, that the project as proposed is zoned for the intended use and has obtained all applicable local land use  approvals  which  allow  the  discretion  of  local  elected  officials  to  be  applied,\n\nexcept that an appeal period may run 30 days beyond that application due date.. When the appeal period, if any, is concluded, the applicant must provide proof that either no appeals were filed, or that any appeals filed during that time were resolved within that 30-day period and the project is ready to proceed.\n\n- (B) For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  'local  land  use  approvals'  includes,  but  is  not limited to, general plan amendments, rezonings, and conditional use permits and does not include design review, initial environmental study assessments, variances, and development agreements.\n- (C) Documentation required to meet the evidentiary burden under subdivision (A) must describe the local approval process, the applicable approvals, and whether each required approval is 'by right,' ministerial, or discretionary. In lieu of a local land use approval,  projects  that  qualify  for  'by  right'  or  ministerial  approval  may  submit confirmation of a development's eligibility for such approval from HCD's Housing Accountability  Unit  or  a  third-party  attorney  letter  that  explains  how  the  project complies with the applicable requirements.\n- (D) The Committee may require, as evidence to meet this requirement, submission of a Committee-provided form letter to be signed by an appropriate local government planning official of the applicable local jurisdiction, including acknowledgment of any zoning or land use approvals pursuant to a state streamlined approval requirement.\n- (E) Rehabilitation  projects  not  requiring  land  use  approvals  are  exempt  from  the requirements above.\n- (5) Financial feasibility.  Applicants shall provide the financing plan for the proposed project and shall demonstrate the proposed project is financially feasible and viable as a qualified low income housing project throughout the extended use period.  A fifteen-year pro forma of all revenue and expense projections, starting as of the planned placed in service date for new construction projects, and as of the rehabilitation completion date for acquisition/rehabilitation projects, is required.  The financial feasibility analysis shall use all underwriting criteria specified in Section 10327 of these regulations.\n- (6) Sponsor  characteristics. Applicants shall provide evidence  that proposed  project participants, as a Development Team, possess all of the knowledge, skills, experience and financial  capacity  to  successfully  develop,  own  and  operate  the  proposed  project.    The Committee  may  conduct  an  investigation  into  an  applicant's  background  that  it  deems necessary, in its sole discretion, and may determine if any of the evidence provided shall disqualify the applicant from  participating in the Credit programs,  or  if additional Development  Team  members  need  be  added  to  appropriately  perform  all  program requirements.\n- (7) Minimum construction standards.  For preliminary reservation applications, applicants shall provide a statement that the following minimum specifications will be incorporated into the project design for all new construction and rehabilitation projects.  In addition, a statement shall  commit  the  property  owner  to  at  least  maintaining  the  applicable  Building  Energy Efficiency Standards (Energy Code, California Code of Regulations, Title 24) adopted by the  California  Energy  Commission  (CEC)  as  well  as  maintaining  the  installed  energy efficiency  and  sustainability  features'  quality  when  replacing  each  of  the  following  listed systems or materials:\n- (A) Energy Efficiency.  All rehabilitated buildings, both competitive and non-competitive, shall meet one of the following:\n- (i) Achieve at least  a 10% post-rehabilitation  improvement  over  existing conditions energy efficiency achieved for the project as a whole, except that\n\nScattered  Site  applications  shall  also  document  at  least  a  5%  postrehabilitation improvement over existing conditions energy efficiency achieved for each site.  In the case of projects in which energy efficiency improvements have been completed within five years prior to the application date or since the last tax credit award pursuant to a public or regulated utility program or other governmental program that established existing conditions of  the  systems  being  replaced  using  a  HERS  Rater,  the  applicant  may include the existing conditions of those systems prior to the improvements.\n\n- (ii) At least 2 out of 3 residential end uses (cooking, space heating, and water heating)  are  electrified,  or  the  building(s)  is  electric  ready  as  defined  in Section 160.9 of the 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Standards.\n- (B) Landscaping.

All Low-Income Units shall provide a refrigerator. All non-SRO LowIncome Units shall provide a range (stovetop and oven), and all SRO Low-Income Units shall include a cooking facility (i.e. a cooktop or microwave). The Executive Director may waive the appliance requirement for SRO units if the project includes a  tenant  common  area  kitchen  facility.  As  applicable,  appliances  provided  or replaced  within  Low-Income  Units  and/or  in  on-site  community  facilities  shall  be ENERGY STAR rated, unless waived by the Executive Director.\n- (F) Window  coverings.    Window  coverings  shall  be  provided  and  may  include  fire retardant drapes or blind.\n- (G) Water heater.

Projects with at least 161 Low-Income and\n\nMarket-Rate Units shall provide a second on-site manager's unit for either another on-site manager or other maintenance personnel, and there shall be one additional on-site manager's unit for either another on-site manager or other  maintenance  personnel  for  each  80  Low-Income  and  Market-Rate Units beyond 161 units, up to a maximum of four on-site manager's units.\n\n- (ii) Scattered  site  projects  totaling  16  or  more  Low-Income  and  Market-Rate Units must have at least one on-site manager's unit for the entire project, and at least one manager's unit at each site where that site's building(s) consist of 16 or more Low-Income and Market-Rate Units.  Scattered sites within 100 yards of each other shall be treated as a single site for purposes of this paragraph.\n- (iii) If an applicant or project owner proposes using a Low-Income Unit to meet the  requirements  of  subdivision  (f)(7)(J),  the  owner  must  comply  with  the Resident  Manager's  Unit  requirements  set  forth  in  CTCAC's  Compliance Manual, available on CTCAC's website (https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/compliance/manual.asp) and incorporated herein by reference.\n- (iv) At the Executive Director's discretion and upon approval by the Executive Director, in lieu of providing an on-site manager, a project may meet the onsite  manager  unit  requirements  of  subdivision  (f)(7)(J)(i)-(ii)  by  providing tenants  with  equivalent  access  to  management  services.  For  example,  a project  may  commit  to  employ  an  equivalent  number  of  on-site  full-time property management staff (at least one of whom is a property manager) and  provide  an  equivalent  number  of  desk  or  security  staff  who  are  not tenants and are capable of responding to emergencies for the hours when property management staff is not working. All staff or contractors performing desk  or  security  work  shall  be  knowledgeable  of  how  the  property's  fire system operates and be trained in, and have participated in, fire evacuation drills for tenants. CTCAC reserves the right to require that one or more onsite  managers'  units  be  provided  and  occupied  by  property  management staff if, in its sole discretion, it determines as part of any on-site inspection that  the  project  has  not  been  adequately  operated  and/or  maintained. Nothing herein relieves the applicant from complying with any other local, state, or federal laws regarding on-site manager units.\n- (K) Accessible Housing Unit(s). All projects shall comply with the Housing and Building Accessibility Requirements in addition to the following, unless otherwise specified:\n- (i) All  new  construction  projects  must  provide  a  minimum  of  fifteen  percent (15%) of the Low-Income Units as Housing Units with Mobility Features, and a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the Low-Income Units as Housing Units with Hearing/Vision Features.\n- (ii) Rehabilitation projects shall provide a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the Low-Income Units as Housing Units with Mobility Features, and four percent (4%) as Housing Units with Hearing/Vision Features.

If no centralized laundry facilities are provided, washers and dryers shall be provided in each of the project's units;\n- (H) Projects are subject to a minimum low-income use period of 55 years (50 years for projects located on tribal trust land);\n- (I) A ten percent (10%) vacancy rate shall be used unless otherwise approved by the Executive Director. Justification of a lower rate shall be included;\n- (J) New construction projects for seniors shall not qualify as SRO housing.\n- (h) Waiting List. At the conclusion of the last reservation cycle of any calendar year, and at no other time, the Committee may establish a Waiting List of pending applications in anticipation of utilizing any Tax Credits that may be returned to the Committee, and/or that have not been allocated to projects with the Set-Asides or Geographic Regions for which they were intended.  The Waiting List shall expire at midnight on December 31 of the year the list is established.  During periods without a waiting list, complete credit awards returned by successful geographic apportionment competitors shall be returned to the apportionment of origin.\n\nStaff shall score, rank and evaluate applications on the Waiting List and make selections from the Waiting List as follows:\n\n- (1) If Credits are fully returned from projects originally funded under Set-Asides or Geographic Apportionments, applications qualifying under the same Set-Aside or Geographic Region will be selected in the order of their ranking. With respect to such a Set-Aside, one or more projects shall receive a reservation until all Credits in a Set-Aside are reserved. With respect to such Geographic Regions in which credits remain available, projects will be funded in order of their rank so long as the region's last award does not cause the region's aggregate award amount to exceed 125 percent (125%) of the amount originally available for that region in that funding round. When the next highest-ranking project does not meet the 125% rule, the Committee shall not fund a project requesting a smaller credit award.\n- (2) Next, Waiting List projects in Set Asides or Geographic Apportionments that are not yet fully subscribed will be selected from the Waiting List for reservations. These will be selected first from the Set Asides in order of their funding sequence, and then from the Geographic Apportionments  in  the  order  of  the  highest  to  the  lowest  percentage  by  which  each Apportionment is undersubscribed.  (This will be calculated by dividing the unreserved Tax Credits in the apportionment by the total Apportionment.)\n- (3) Finally, after all Set-Asides and Geographic Apportionments for the current year have been achieved, or if no further projects are available for such reservations, the unallocated Tax Credits will be used for projects selected from the Waiting List, in the order of their score and tie breaker performance ranking, without regard to Set-Aside or Geographic Region. All Waiting List project reservations, except for Rural projects, will be counted toward the projects' Geographic Apportionments.\n- (4) If there are not sufficient federal Tax Credits to fully fund the next ranked application on the Waiting List, a reservation of all remaining federal Tax Credits and a binding commitment of the following year federal Tax Credits may be made to that application.\n5. (i) Carry forward of Tax Credits.  Pursuant to Federal and state statutes, the Committee may carry forward any unused Tax Credits or Tax Credits returned to the Committee for allocation in the next calendar year.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.

All applications requesting Federal Tax Credits under the requirements of IRC Section 42(h)(4) for buildings and land, the aggregate basis (including land) of which is financed at least fifty  percent  (50%)  by  tax-exempt  bonds,  shall  be  eligible  to  apply  under  this  Section  for  a reservation and allocation of Federal Tax Credits.  Those projects requesting State Tax Credits pursuant  to  subsection  (g)(1)(A)  of  Sections  12206,  17058,  and  23610.5  of  the  Revenue  and Taxation Code will also be subject to the applicable requirements of Section 10317. All applicants requesting Tax Credits for projects financed with tax-exempt bonds shall apply simultaneously to the CDLAC and CTCAC and shall use the CDLAC-CTCAC Joint Application.  Applications will be eligible  for  a  reservation  of  tax  credits  only  if  receiving  a  bond  allocation  pursuant  to  a  joint application.\n- (b) Applicable criteria.    Selection  criteria  for  applications  reviewed  under  this  Section  shall  include those required by IRC Section 42(m), this Section 10326, and Sections 10300, 10302, 10305, 10320, 10322, 10327, 10328(e), 10330, 10335, and 10337 of these regulations.  Other sections of these regulations shall not apply.  The first funding round shall be the first application review period of a calendar year for tax-exempt bond financed projects.\n\n- (1) Subject to conditions described in these Regulations, reservations of Federal and State Tax  Credits  shall  be  made  for  those  applications  that  receive  a  bond  allocation  from CDLAC until the established State Tax Credit allocation amount is exhausted.  If the last application  requires  more  State  Tax  Credits  than  remain  for  the  calendar  year,  that application will not be funded, and the remaining credits will be either funded through the Waiting List or carried forward into the next calendar year. If there is not sufficient State Tax Credits to allocate to applications recommended for tax-exempt bonds by CDLAC, the State Tax Credits will be allocated based on ranking within the CDLAC pools and set asides in the following order:\n2. (A) Black, Indigenous, or Other People of Color (BIPOC) Project Pool;\n3. (C) New Construction Pool, Homeless Projects Set Aside;\n4. (B) Rural Project Pool;\n5. (D) New Construction Pool, ELI/VLI Project Set Aside;\n6. (F) All remaining New Construction Pool Projects\n7. (E) New Construction Pool, Mixed-Income Project Set Aside; and\n- (2) For State Tax Credits pursuant to Section 10317(j) of these Regulations, an amount up to $200,000,000 in a calendar year may be allocated for housing financed by CalHFA's Mixed-Income  Program  (MIP)  that  also  receives  a  bond  allocation  from  CDLAC. Applications with financing by CalHFA (MIP) will be accepted in any funding round.  The amount allocated for  CalHFA MIP may be reduced upon agreement of the Executive Directors of CalHFA and CTCAC.\n9. At  the  conclusion  of  the  final  funding  round  of  a  calendar  year,  the  Committee  may establish a Waiting List of pending applications in anticipation of utilizing any State Tax Credits that may be returned to the Committee, and/or that have not been allocated to projects for which they were intended. The Waiting List shall expire on December 31 of the year the list is established.\n10. (c) Application  review  period.    The  Committee  may  require  up  to  sixty  (60)  days  to  review  an application, and an additional thirty (30) days to consider the application for a reservation of Tax Credits.  Applicants must deliver applications no less than ninety (90) days prior to the CTCAC Committee meeting in which they wish to obtain a decision.  Applications not expected to receive a  bond  allocation  from  CDLAC  due  to  relatively  low  CDLAC  scores  may  or  may  not  be  fully evaluated by the CTCAC.\n11. Applications requesting State Tax Credits allocated pursuant to subsections (g)(1)(A) and (B) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and not in compliance with the application completeness requirements of Sections 10322(d) and (e) of these Regulations shall be considered incomplete and shall be disqualified from receiving a reservation of Tax Credits during the cycle in which the application was determined incomplete.\n12. (d) Issuer determination of Credit.  The issuer of the bonds may determine the Federal Tax Credit amount, with said determination verified by the Committee and submitted with the application. The issuer may request the Committee determine the Credit amount by including such request in the application.\n13. (e) Additional application requirements.  Applications submitted pursuant to this Section shall provide the following additional information:\n- (1) the name, phone number and contact person of the bond issuer; and,\n- (2) verification provided by the bond issuer of the availability of the bond financing, the actual or  estimated  bond  issuance  date, and  the  actual  or  estimated  percentage  of  aggregate basis (including land) financed or to be financed by the bonds, and a certification provided\n\nby a third-party tax professional as to the expected or actual aggregate basis (including land) financed by the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds;\n\n- (3) the name, phone number and contact person of any entity providing credit enhancement and the type of enhancement provided.\n2. (f) Application evaluation.  To receive a reservation of Tax Credits, applications submitted under this Section shall be evaluated, pursuant to IRC Section 42, H &amp; S Code Sections 50199.4 through 50199.22, R &amp; T Code Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5, and these regulations to determine if:  eligible,  by  meeting all program eligibility requirements; complete, which includes meeting all basic threshold requirements; and financially feasible.\n3.

Applicants shall provide evidence that as a Development Team, proposed  project  participants  possess  the  knowledge,  skills,  experience  and  financial capacity to successfully develop, own and operate the proposed project.  The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine if any of the evidence provided shall disqualify the applicant from participating in the Tax Credit Programs, or if additional Development Team members  need  be  added  to  appropriately  perform  all  program  requirements.    General partners  and  management  companies  lacking  documented  experience  with  Section  42 requirements using the minimum scoring standards at Section 10325(c)(1)(A) and (B) shall be required to complete training as prescribed by CTCAC per Section 10325(c)(1) prior to a project's placing in service.  The minimum scoring standards referenced herein shall not be  obtained  through  the  two  (2)  point  category  of  'a  housing  tax  credit  certification examination  of  a  nationally  recognized  housing  tax  credit  compliance  entity  on  a  list maintained  by  the  Committee  to  satisfy  minimum  management  company  experience requirements  for  an  incoming  management  agent'  established  at  Section  10325(c)(1). Applicants need not submit the third-party public accountant certification that the projects have maintained a positive operating cash flow.\n\nThe State Tax Credit allocation pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(B) of Sections 12206, 17058, and 23610.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code received by individuals, entities, affiliates, and related entities is limited to no more than thirty-three percent (33%) of any amount established  per  application  review  period  as  described  in  Section  10326(c)  of  these Regulations.  This limitation is applicable to a project applicant, developer, sponsor, owner,\n\n(8)\n\ngeneral partner, and to parent companies, principals of entities, and family members.  For the purposes of this section, related or non-arm's length relationships are further defined as those having control or joint control over an entity, having significant influence over an entity, or participating as key management of an entity.  Related entity disclosure is required at the time of application.  This 33% limit is not applicable for reservations of State Tax Credits made after the month of May in each calendar year.\n\n- (6) Minimum  construction  standards.    Applicants  shall  adhere  to  minimum  construction standards as set forth in Section 10325(f)(7).\n- (7) Minimum Rehabilitation Project Costs.  Projects involving rehabilitation of existing buildings shall be required to complete, at a minimum, the higher of:\n3. (A) $15,000 in hard construction costs per unit; or\n4. (B) 20% of the adjusted basis of the building pursuant to IRC Section 42(e)(3)(A)(ii)(I).\n5. (A) Existing tax credit projects applying for additional tax credits for acquisition and/or rehabilitation  (i.e.,  resyndication)  shall  maintain  the  rents  and  income  targeting levels  in  the  existing  regulatory  contract  for  the  duration  of  the  new  regulatory contract. If the project has exhibited negative cash flow for at least each of the last three years or within the next five years will lose a rental or operating subsidy that was factored into the project's initial feasibility, the Executive Director may alter this requirement, provided that the new rents and income targeting levels shall be as low as possible to maintain project feasibility. In addition, the Executive Director may approve a reduction in the number of units for purposes of unrestricting a manager's unit, adding or increasing service or community space, or for adding bathrooms and kitchens to SRO units, provided that the existing rent and income targeting remain proportional.\n6. (B) If  the  regulatory  agreement  for  an  existing  tax  credit  project  applying  for  a  new reservation  of  tax  credits  for  acquisition  and/or  rehabilitation  (i.e.,  resyndication) contains a requirement to provide service amenities, even if that requirement has expired, the project shall provide a similar or greater level of services for a period of at least 15 years under the new regulatory agreement. A project obtaining maximum CDLAC points for services shall be deemed to have met this requirement. If the project has exhibited cash flow of less than $20,000 for at least each of the last three years, has no hard debt and fails to break even in year 15 with services, or within the next five years will lose a rental or operation subsidy that was factored into the project's initial feasibility, the Executive Director may alter this requirement, provided that the service expenditures shall be the maximum that project feasibility allows.\n7. (C) For  existing  tax  credit  projects  applying  for  a  new  reservation  of  tax  credits  for acquisition and/or rehabilitation (i.e., resyndication), the pre-rehabilitation reserve study in the CNA shall demonstrate a rehabilitation need of at least $5,000 per unit over the first three years. Projects for which the Executive Director has waived the requirements of Section 10320(b)(4) and projects with ten years or less remaining on the CTCAC regulatory agreement are exempt from this requirement.\n- (9) A non-competitive project that includes Low-Income Units targeted at greater than 60% AMI shall have average targeting that does not exceed 60% AMI.  A competitive project that includes Low-Income Units targeted at greater than 60% AMI shall have average targeting that does not exceed 50% AMI.  Projects electing the average income federal set-aside must choose targeting in 10% increments of AMI (i.e. 20% AMI, 30% AMI, 40% AMI, etc.).\n\nA project with a tax credit reservation dated prior to, or a submitted application pending as of, March 26, 2018 may, with the discretionary approval of the Executive Director, revise its targeting prior to the recordation of the regulatory agreement to include Low-Income Units\n\ntargeted at greater than 60% AMI only to increase the number of Low-Income Units or to accommodate existing over-income tenants, provided that the average targeting does not exceed 60% AMI for non-competitive projects or 50% AMI for competitive projects.\n\nA project including Low-Income Units targeted at greater than 60% AMI shall make the 'Yes' election on line 8b of the IRS Form 8609.\n\n- (h) Reserved.\n- (i) Tax-exempt bond reservations.    Reservations  of  Tax  Credits  shall  be  subject  to  conditions  as described in this Section and applicable statutes.  Reservations of Tax Credits shall be conditioned upon the Committee's receipt of the reservation fee described in Section 10335 and an executed reservation letter  bearing  the  applicant's  signature  accepting  the  reservation  within  twenty  (20) calendar days of the Committee's notice to the applicant of the reservation, except that Hybrid projects and simultaneous phased projects as defined in Section 10327(c)(2)(C) shall submit the acceptance  of  the  reservation  for  the  first  application  within  five  (5)  business  days  of  the Committee's notice to the applicant of the reservation for the corresponding second application.\n- (j) Additional  conditions  on  reservations. The  following  additional  conditions  shall apply  to reservations of Tax Credits pursuant to this Section:\n- (1) Bonds issued.  Bonds shall be issued within the time limit specified by CDLAC, if applicable; and,\n- (2) Projects shall maintain at least 10% of the total Low-Income Units at rents affordable to tenants earning 50% or less of the AMI and shall maintain a minimum 30 year affordability period.\n- (3) Projects proposing the rehabilitation of existing structures shall provide CTCAC with an updated development timetable by December 31 of the year following the year the project received its reservation of Tax Credits.\n- (i) The report shall include the actual placed-in-service date or the anticipated placedin-service date for the last building in the project and the date the project achieved full occupancy.  The report shall detail the causes for any change from the original date.\n- (ii) Projects  proposing  new  construction  shall  provide  CTCAC  with  an  updated development timetable by December 31 of the second year following the year the project received its reservation of Tax Credits.  The update shall include the actual placed-in-service  date  for  the  last  building  in  the  project  and  the  date  that  the project achieved full occupancy; or the date the project is anticipated to achieve full occupancy.\n\nOther conditions, including cancellation, disqualification and other sanctions imposed by the Committee in furtherance of the purposes of the Credit programs.\n\n- (4) Projects intended for eventual tenant homeownership must submit, at application, evidence of a financially feasible program, incorporating, among other items, an exit strategy, home ownership counseling, funds to be set aside to assist tenants in the purchase of units, and a  plan  for  conversion  of  the  facility  to  home  ownership  at  the  end  of  the  initial  15-year compliance period. In such a case, the regulatory agreement will contain provisions for the enforcement of such covenants.\n2. (k) Placed-in-service.  Upon completion of construction of the proposed project, the applicant shall submit documentation required by Section 10322(i).\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.\n\nReference: Sections 12206, 17058 and 23610.5, Revenue and Taxation Code; and Sections 50199.4, 50199.5,  50199.6,  50199.7,  50199.8,  50199.9,  50199.10,  50199.11,  50199.12,  50199.13,  50199.14, 50199.15, 50199.16, 50199.17, 50199.18, 50199.20, 50199.21 and 50199.22, Health and Safety Code.",

      "content": "## Section 10327.  Financial Feasibility and Determination of Credit Amounts.\n\n- (a) General.  Applicants shall demonstrate that the proposed project is financially feasible as a qualified low-income housing project.  Development and operational costs shall be reasonable and within limits  established  by  the  Committee,  and  the  Committee  may  adjust  these  costs  and  any corresponding basis at any time prior to issuance of tax forms.  Approved sources of funds shall be sufficient to cover approved uses of funds, except that initial application errors  resulting in a shortage of sources up to the higher of $100,000 or 50% of the contingency line item shall be deemed  covered  by  the  contingency  line  item.    If  it  is  determined  that  sources  of  funds  are insufficient, an application shall be deemed not to have met basic threshold requirements and shall be  considered  incomplete.    Following  its  initial  and  subsequent  feasibility  determinations,  the Committee may determine a lesser amount of Tax Credits for which the proposed project is eligible, pursuant to the requirements herein, and may rescind a reservation or allocation of Tax Credits in the event that the maximum amount of Tax Credits achievable is insufficient for financial feasibility.\n- (b) Limitation on determination.  A Committee determination of financial feasibility in no way warrants to any applicant, investor, lender or others that the proposed project is, in fact, feasible.\n- (c) Reasonable cost determination.  IRC Section 42(m) requires that the housing Credit dollar amount allocated to a project not exceed the amount the housing Credit agency determines is necessary for the financial feasibility of the project.  The following standards shall apply:\n- (1) Builder overhead, profit and general requirements.  An overall cost limitation of fourteen percent (14%) of the cost of construction shall apply to builder overhead, profit, and general requirements,  excluding  builder's  general  liability  insurance.    For  purposes  of  builder overhead and profit, the cost of construction includes offsite improvements, demolition and site work, structures, prevailing wages, and general requirements.  For purposes of general requirements, the cost of construction includes offsite improvements, demolition and site work, structures, and prevailing wages.  Project developers shall not enter into fixed-price contracts that do not account for these restrictions and shall disclose any payments for services from the builder to the developer.\n- (2) Developer Fee.\n- (A) The maximum developer fee that may be included in project costs and eligible basis for  9% competitive credit new construction, rehabilitation only, or adaptive reuse applications applying under Section 10325 of these regulations is the lesser of 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis and 15% of the basis for non-residential costs included in the project allocated on a pro rata basis or two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000).  The maximum developer fee that may be included in project costs and eligible basis for a 9% competitive credit acquisition/rehabilitation application is the lesser of 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible  construction  related  basis  plus  5%  of  the  project's  unadjusted  eligible acquisition  basis  and  15%  for  the  basis  for  non-residential  costs  included  in  the project allocated on a pro rata basis or two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000).\n\nNotwithstanding the paragraph above, for projects which restrict for  Special Needs Population(s) the greater of 1) 15 Low-Income Units or 2) 25% of the Low-Income Units, the maximum developer fee that may be included in project costs and eligible basis  for  9%  competitive  credit  new  construction,  rehabilitation  only,  or  adaptive reuse applications applying under Section 10325 of these regulations is the lesser of  15%  of  the  project's  unadjusted  eligible  basis  and  15%  of  the  basis  for  nonresidential costs included in the project allocated on a pro rata basis or two million\n\neight hundred thousand dollars ($2,800,000). The maximum developer fee that may be  included  in  project  costs  and  eligible  basis  for  a  9%  competitive  credit acquisition/rehabilitation application is the lesser of 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible  construction  related  basis  plus  5%  of  the  project's  unadjusted  eligible acquisition  basis  and  15%  for  the  basis  for  non-residential  costs  included  in  the project allocated on a pro rata basis or two million eight hundred thousand dollars ($2,800,000).\n\n- (B) For 4% credit applications applying under Section 10326 of these regulations, the maximum developer fee that may be included in project costs and eligible basis shall be as follows:\n- (i) For  new  construction,  rehabilitation  only,  or  adaptive  reuse  projects,  the maximum developer fee is the sum of 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis and 15% of the basis for non-residential costs included in the project allocated on a pro rata basis.\n\nAll developer fees in excess of the greater of the following shall be deferred or contributed as equity to the project:\n\n- 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis, up to two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000); or\n- one million dollars ($1,000,000) plus 5% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis in excess of six million six hundred sixty six thousand six hundred sixty seven dollars ($6,666,667).\n\nNotwithstanding the paragraph above, for projects which restrict for Special Needs Population(s) the greater of 1) 15 Low-Income Units or 2) 25% of the Low-Income Units, all developer fees in excess of the greater of the following shall be deferred or contributed as equity to the project:\n\n- 15%  of  eligible  basis,  up  to  two  million  eight  hundred  thousand  dollars ($2,800,000); or\n- one million dollars ($1,000,000) plus 7% of eligible basis in excess of six million  six  hundred  sixty  six  thousand  six  hundred  sixty  seven  dollars ($6,666,667).\n- (ii) For acquisition/rehabilitation projects, the maximum developer fee is 15% of the unadjusted eligible construction related basis and 5% of the unadjusted eligible  acquisition  basis  and  15%  of  the  basis  for  non-residential  costs included  in  the  project  allocated  on  a  pro  rata  basis.  15%  of  the  project's unadjusted eligible acquisition basis will be permitted for at-risk developments meeting the requirements of section 10325(g)(4) or for other acquisition/rehabilitation projects, except  for existing tax credit projects applying for a new reservation of tax credits for acquisition (i.e. resyndication), whose hard construction costs per unit in rehabilitation expenditures are at least $50,000 or where the development will restrict at least 30% of its Low Income Units for those with incomes no greater than 50% of area median and restrict rents concomitantly.\n\nAll developer fees in excess of the greater of the following shall be deferred or contributed as equity to the project:\n\n- 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible construction related basis plus 5% of the project's unadjusted eligible acquisition basis, up to two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000); provided however, and subject to the $2,500,000 limitation in the aggregate, 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible acquisition basis will be permitted for at-risk developments meeting\n\n- the requirements of section 10325(g)(4) or for other acquisition/rehabilitation  projects,  except  for  existing  tax  credit  projects applying for a new reservation of tax credits for acquisition (i.e. resyndication),  whose  hard  construction  costs  per  unit  in  rehabilitation expenditures are at least $50,000 or where the development will restrict at least 30% of its Low Income Units for those with incomes no greater than 50% of area median and restrict rents concomitantly; or\n- one million dollars ($1,000,000) plus 5% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis in excess of six million six hundred sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty seven dollars ($6,666,667).\n\nNotwithstanding the paragraph above, for projects which restrict for Special Needs Population(s) the greater of 1) 15 Low-Income Units or 2) 25% of the Low-Income Units, all developer fees in excess of the greater of the following shall be deferred or contributed as equity to the project:\n\n- 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible construction related basis plus 5% of the project's unadjusted eligible acquisition basis, up to two million eight hundred thousand dollars ($2,800,000); provided however, and subject to the $2,800,000 limitation in the aggregate, 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible acquisition basis will be permitted for at-risk developments meeting the requirements of section 10325(g)(4) or for other acquisition/rehabilitation  projects,  except  for  existing  tax  credit  projects applying for a new reservation of tax credits for acquisition (i.e. resyndication),  whose  hard  construction  costs  per  unit  in  rehabilitation expenditures are at least $50,000 or where the development will restrict at least 30% of its Low Income Units for those with incomes no greater than 50% of area median and restrict rents concomitantly; or\n- one million dollars ($1,000,000) plus 7% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis in excess of six million six hundred sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty seven dollars ($6,666,667).\n- (iii) Notwithstanding  (i)  and  (ii),  effective  through  December  31,  2028,  any developer  fee  in  excess  of  $6,000,000  shall  be  deferred  or  contributed  as equity to the project. Prior to December 31, 2028, the Committee shall meet to discuss the application of any developer fee in excess of $6,000,000.\n- (C) For purposes of this subsection, the unadjusted eligible basis is determined without consideration of the developer fee.  With exception of 4% projects with a 2016 or later reservation, the developer fee in cost and in basis shall not be increased once established by a reservation of Tax Credits but may be decreased in the event of a modification  in  basis.    Once  established  by  a  reservation  of  Tax  Credits,  the developer fee in cost and in basis for a 4% project with a 2016 or later reservation may increase or decrease in the event of modification in basis, and in the cases it is increased,  any  increase  above  the  maximum  developer  fee  established  at reservation shall be additionally deferred or contributed as equity to the project. The maximum  developer fees above apply to projects developed as multiple simultaneous phases using the same credit type: (2)(A) applies to all simultaneous phases using all 9% credits and (2)(B) above applies to all simultaneous phases using all 4% credits.  Only when the immediately preceding phase of an all 9% credit phased project equals or exceeds 150 units or when any other phased project is using both credit types shall the provision of (2)(A) and (2)(B) apply to each phase independently.    For  purposes  of  this  limitation,  unless  waived  by  the  Executive Director, 'simultaneous' refers to projects consisting of a single building, or projects on the same parcel or on parcels within \u00bc mile of each other and with construction start dates within six months of each other, or completion dates that are within six months of each other.\n\n- (D) Deferred fees and costs.  Deferral of project development costs shall not exceed an amount equal to seven-and-one-half percent (7.5%) of the unadjusted eligible basis of  the  proposed project prior to addition of the developer fee.  Unless expressly required by a State or local public funding source, in no case may the applicant propose deferring project development costs in excess of half (50%) of the proposed developer fee.  Tax-exempt bond projects shall not be subject to this limitation.\n- Deferred developer fee notes and/or agreements must be included in the placed-inservice  application  and  the  interest  rates  of  such  notes  shall  not  exceed  eight percent (8%).\n- (E) Black, Indigenous, or Other People of Color (BIPOC).  For projects that qualify for general  partner  experience  pursuant  to  Section  5230(f)(1)(B)  of  the  CDLAC Regulations,  the  15%  of  project's  unadjusted  eligible  construction  related  basis stated  in  Section  10327(c)(2)(B)  shall  be  increased  to  20%  of  the  project's unadjusted  eligible  construction  related  basis  and  the  two  million  five  hundred thousand ($2,500,000) dollars in subsection (c)(2)(B) above, is increased to three million ($3,000,000) dollars.\n- (3) Syndication expenses. A cost limitation on syndication expenses, excluding bridge loan costs, shall be twenty percent (20%) of the gross syndication proceeds, if the sale of Tax Credits  is  through  a  public  offering  or  private  Securities  and  Commission  Regulation  D offering, and ten percent (10%) of the gross syndication proceeds, if the sale is through a private offering.  The Executive Director may allow exceptions to the above limitation, in amounts not to exceed twenty-four percent (24%) for public offerings and private Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation D offerings, and fifteen percent (15%) for private offerings, should the following circumstances be present: smaller than average project size; complex  financing  structure  due  to  multiple  sources;  complex  land  lease  or  ownership structure;  higher  than  average  investor  yield  requirements,  due  to  higher  than  average investor risk; and, little or no anticipated project cash allowing lower-than-market investor returns.  Syndication costs cannot be included as a cost or included in eligible basis.\n- (4) Net  syndication  proceeds.    The  Executive  Director  shall  evaluate  the  net  syndication proceeds to ensure that project sources do not exceed uses and that the sale of Tax Credits generates proceeds equivalent to amounts paid in comparable syndication raises.  The Executive Director shall determine the minimum tax credit factor to be used in all initial applications prior to the beginning of a funding cycle for projects applying under Section 10325 for both Federal and State Tax Credits.  The minimum tax credit factor for initial applications made under Section 10326 shall be adjusted annually based on current market conditions.\n- (5) Threshold Basis Limits.  At application, the Committee shall limit the unadjusted eligible basis  amount,  used  for  calculating  the  maximum  amount  of  Tax  Credits  to  amounts published on its  website  in  effect  at  the  time  of  application  and  in  accordance  with  the Threshold Basis Limit definition in Section 10302 of these regulations. At placed in service, the Committee shall limit the unadjusted eligible basis amount to the higher of the amount published on its website in effect at the time of application or in effect for the year the project places in service.\n\n## Exceptions to limits.\n\n- (A) Increases  in  the  threshold  basis  limits  shall  be  permitted  as  follows  for  projects applying under Section 10325 or 10326 of these regulations.\n- A twenty percent (20%) increase to limits for a development that is paid for in whole or in part out of public funds and is subject to a legal requirement for the payment of state or federal prevailing wages on the entire project or financed in part by a laboraffiliated organization that requires the employment of construction workers who are\n\npaid  at  least  state  or  federal  prevailing  wages.  An  additional  five  percent  (5%) increase to the unadjusted eligible basis shall be available for projects that certify that they are subject to a project labor agreement within the meaning of Section 2500(b)(1) of the Public Contract Code that requires the employment of construction workers who are paid at least state or federal prevailing wages or that they will use a skilled and trained workforce, as defined in Section 25536.7 of the Health and Safety Code, to perform all onsite work within an apprenticeable occupation in the building and construction trades. All applicants under this paragraph shall certify that contractors and subcontractors will comply with Section 1725.5 of the Labor Code, if applicable;\n\nA ten percent (10%) increase to the limits for a new construction development where parking is required to be provided beneath the residential units (but not 'tuck under' parking) or through construction of an on-site parking structure of two or more levels;\n\nA two percent (2%) increase to the limits where a day care center is part of the development;\n\nA two percent (2%) increase to the limits where 100% of the Low-Income Units are for special needs populations;\n\nA ten percent (10%) increase to the limits for a development wherein at least 95% of the project's upper floor units are serviced by an elevator.\n\nA fifteen percent (15%) increase to the limits for a development wherein at least 95% of the building(s) is constructed as Type I as defined in the California Building Code, in which case, the Type III increase below (10%) shall not be allowed.\n\nA ten percent (10%) increase to the limits for a development wherein at least 95% of the building(s) is constructed as (1) a Type III as defined in the California Building Code, or (2) a Type III/Type I combination, in which case, the Type I increase above (15%) shall not be allowed.\n\nWith the exception of the prevailing wage increase, the Local Impact Fee increase, and the special needs increase, in order to receive the basis limit increases by the corresponding  percentage(s)  listed  above,  a  certification  signed  by  the  project architect  shall  be  provided  within  the  initial  and  placed-in-service  application confirming that item(s) listed above will be or have been incorporated into the project design, respectively.\n\n- (B) A further increase of up to twenty percent (20%) in the Threshold Basis Limits will be permitted for projects applying under Section 10325 or Section 10326 of these regulations  that  include  one  or  more  of  the  following  energy  efficiency/resource conservation/indoor air quality items:\n- (1) All electric. Twenty percent (20%)\n- (2) For rehabilitation projects, electric ready as defined in Section 160.9 of the 2022 Building Energy Efficiency Standards. Fifteen percent (15%)\n- (3) Project  shall  have  onsite  renewable  generation  estimated  to  produce  50 percent  (50%)  or  more  of  annual  tenant  electricity  use.    If  the  combined available roof area of the project structures, including carports, is insufficient for  provision  of  50%  of  annual  electricity  use,  then  the  project  shall  have onsite  renewable  generation  based  on  at  least  90  percent  (90%)  of  the available  solar  accessible  roof  area.    Available  solar  accessible  area  is defined as roof area less north facing roof area for sloped roofs, equipment, solar thermal hot water and required local or state fire department set-backs\n\n- and  access  routes.    A  project  not  availing  itself  of  the  90%  roof  area exception  may  also  receive  an  increase  under  paragraph  (2)  only  if  the renewable  generation  used  to  calculate  each  basis  increase  does  not overlap. Five percent (5%)\n- (4) Project  shall  have  onsite  renewable  generation  estimated  to  produce  75 percent  (75%)  or  more  of  annual  common  area  electricity  use.    If  the combined available roof area of the project structures, including carports, is insufficient for provision of 75% of annual electricity use, then the project shall have onsite renewable generation based on at least 90 percent (90%) of the available solar accessible roof area.  Available solar accessible area is  defined  as  roof  area  less  north  facing  roof  area  for  sloped  roofs, equipment,  solar  thermal  hot water  and  required  local or state fire department set-backs and access routes.  A project not availing itself of the 90% roof area exception may also receive an increase under paragraph (1) only if the renewable generation used to calculate each basis increase does not overlap. Two percent (2%)\n- (5) Newly constructed project buildings shall be 15% more energy efficient than the applicable Building Energy Efficiency Standards (Energy Code, California  Code  of  Regulations,  Title  24)  for  energy  efficiency  alone  (not counting solar).  Four percent (4%)\n- (6) Rehabilitated project buildings shall have eighty percent (80%) decrease in estimated  TDV  energy  use  (or  improvement  in  energy  efficiency)  post rehabilitation as demonstrated using the appropriate performance module of CEC approved software.  Four percent (4%)\n- (7) Irrigate only with reclaimed water, greywater, or rainwater (excepting water used for Community Gardens) or irrigate with reclaimed water, grey water, or rainwater in an amount that annually equals or exceeds 20,000 gallons or 300 gallons per unit, whichever is less.  One percent (1%)\n- (8) Community Gardens of at least 60 square feet per unit.  Permanent site improvements  that  provide  a  viable  growing  space  within  the  project including solar access, fencing, watering systems, secure storage space for tools, and pedestrian access.  One percent (1%)\n- (9) Install  bamboo,  stained  concrete,  cork,  salvaged  or  FSC-Certified  wood, natural linoleum, natural rubber, or ceramic tile in all kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms (where no VOC adhesives or backing is also used).  One percent (1%)\n- (10) Install  bamboo,  stained  concrete,  cork,  salvaged  or  FSC-Certified  wood, natural linoleum, natural rubber, or ceramic tile in all interior floor space other than units (where no VOC adhesives or backing is also used).  Two percent (2%)\n- (11) For new construction projects, meet all requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Indoor Air Plus Program.  Two percent (2%)\n\nCompliance and Verification:  For placed-in-service applications, in order to receive the increase to the basis limit, the application shall contain a certification from a HERS, GreenPoint, NGBS Green Verifier, PHIUS, Passive House, or Living Building Challenge Rater, or from a LEED for Homes Green Rater verifying that item(s) listed above have been incorporated into the project, except that items (7) through (10) may be verified by the project architect. For items (3) through (6), the applicant must\n\nsubmit  a  certification  from  a  third-party  certified  HERS  Rater  with  the  original application and the placed-in-service application.  For item (7), the Rater, architect, landscape architect, or water system engineer shall certify that reclaimed water, greywater, or rainwater systems have been installed and are functioning to supply sufficient irrigation to the property to meet the standards under normal conditions. Failure to incorporate the features, or to submit the appropriate documentation may result in a reduction in credits awarded and/or an award of negative points.\n\n- (C) Additionally,  for  projects  applying  under  Section  10326  of  these  regulations,  an increase of one percent (1%) in the threshold basis limits shall be available for every 1% of the project's Low-Income and Market Rate Units that will be income and rent restricted at or below 50 percent (50%) but above thirty-five percent (35%) of AMI. An increase of two percent (2%) shall be available for every 1% of the project's LowIncome and Market Rate Units that will be restricted at or below 35% of AMI.  In addition, the applicant must agree to maintain the affordability period of the project for 55 years (50 years for projects located on tribal trust land).\n- (D) Projects requiring seismic upgrading of existing structures, and/or projects requiring on-site toxic or other environmental mitigation may be permitted an increase in basis limit equal to the lesser of the amount of costs associated with the seismic upgrading or one-site environmental mitigation or 15% of the project's unadjusted eligible basis to the extent that the project architect or seismic engineer certifies in the application to the costs associated with such work.\n- (E) An increase equal to any Local Development Impact Fees as defined in Section 10302 of these regulations if the fees are documented in the application submission by the entities charging such fees.\n- (F) In a county that has an unadjusted 9% threshold basis limit for a 2-bedroom unit equal  to  or  less  than  $500,000,  a  ten  percent  (10%)  increase  to  the  project's threshold basis limit for a development located in a census tract, or census block group  as  applicable,  designated  on  the  CTCAC/HCD  Opportunity  Area  Map  as Highest or High Resource.\n- An  applicant  may  choose  to  utilize  the  census  tract,  or  census  block  group  as applicable, resource designation from the CTCAC/HCD Opportunity Maps in effect when the initial site control was obtained up to seven calendar years prior to the application.\n- (6) Acquisition costs.  All applications must include the cost of land and improvements in the Sources and Uses budget, except that (i) competitive projects with donated land and/or improvements shall include the appraised value of the donated land and improvements that is not nominal, and (ii) projects on tribal trust land need only provide an improvement cost or  value.    If  the  acquisition  for  a  new  construction  project  involves  a  Related  Party,  the applicant shall disclose the relationship at the time of initial application.\n\nOnce established in the initial application, the acquisition cost of a new construction site shall not increase except as provided below for land and improvements donated or leased. Except as allowed pursuant to Section 10322(h)(9)(A) or by a waiver pursuant to this section below for projects basing cost on assumed debt, neither the purchase price nor the basis associated with existing improvements, if any, shall increase during all subsequent reviews including the placed-in-service review.\n\nIf  land  or  land  and  improvements  (real  property)  are  donated  to  the  general  partner  or member of the project owner and if approved by CTCAC in advance, the general partner or member may sell the real property to the project for an amount equal to the donated value established in the application provided that: there must be a seller carryback loan for the full amount of the sale, the loan must be 'soft,' having a term of at least 15 years, a below\n\nmarket interest rate and interest accrual, and be either fully deferred or require only residual receipts payments for the loan term.  Alternatively, the value may be a capital contribution of a general partner or member.  Once established in the initial application, the donated value of the real property shall not increase.\n\nIf land or land and improvements (real property) are donated or are leased for a mandatory lease payment of $100 per year or less, and if approved by CTCAC in advance, the donation value established in the application may be a capital contribution of a general partner or member.  Once  established  in  the  initial  application,  the  donated  value  of  the  real property/lease shall not increase.\n\n- (A) New Construction. The cost of land acquired through a third-party transaction with an unrelated party shall be evidenced by a sales agreement, purchase contract, or escrow closing statement. The value of land acquired from a Related Party shall be underwritten  using  the  lesser  of  the  current  purchase  price  or  appraised  value pursuant to Section 10322(h)(9). If the purchase price exceeds appraised value, the applicant shall, within the shortfall calculation section of the basis and credits page of the application only, reduce the project cost and the soft permanent financing by the overage. For all other purposes, the project cost shall include the overage.\n- The value of donated land, including land donated as part of an inclusionary housing ordinance, must be evidenced by an appraisal pursuant to Section 10322(h)(9).\n- (B) Rehabilitation. Except as noted below, the applicant shall provide a sales agreement or  purchase  contract  in  additional  to  the  appraisal.  The  value  of  land  and improvements shall be underwritten using the lesser amount of the purchase price or  the  'as  is'  appraised  value  of  the  subject  property  (as  defined  in  Section 10322(h)(9)) and its existing improvements without consideration of the future use of the property as rent restricted housing except if the property has existing long term rent restrictions that affect the as-is value of the property. The land value shall be based upon an 'as if vacant' value as determined by the appraisal methodology described in Section 10322(h)(9) of these regulations. If the purchase price is less than  the  appraised  value,  the  savings  shall  be  prorated  between  the  land  and improvements based on the ratio in the appraisal. If the purchase price exceeds appraised value, the applicant shall (i) limit improvements acquisition basis to the amount supported by the appraisal and (ii) within the shortfall calculation section of the basis and credits page of the application only, reduce the project cost and the soft permanent financing, exclusive of any developer fee that must be deferred or contributed  pursuant  to  Section  10327(c)(2)(B),  by  the  overage.  For  all  other purposes, the project cost shall include the overage.\n\nThe Executive Director may approve a waiver to underwrite the project with a purchase price in excess of the appraised value where (i) a local governmental entity is purchasing, or providing funds for the purchase of land for more than its appraised value in designated revitalization area when the local governmental entity has determined that the higher cost is  justified,  or  (ii)  the  purchase  price  does  not  exceed  the  sum  of  third-party  debt encumbering the property that will be assumed or paid off.\n\nFor tax-exempt bond-funded properties receiving credits under Section 10326 only or in combination with State Tax Credits and exercising the option to forgo an appraisal pursuant to  Section  10322(h)(9)(A),  no  sales  agreement  or  purchase  contract  is  required,  and CTCAC shall approve a reasonable proration of land and improvement value consistent with similar projects in the market area.\n\n- (7) Reserve accounts.  All reserve accounts shall be used to maintain the property (which does not include repayment of loans) and/or benefit its residents, and shall remain with the project except as provided in subparagraph (B) below and except when a public lender funds rent subsidy and/or service reserves and requires repayment of unused rent subsidy and/or\n\nservice reserves.  If ownership of a project is transferred, the reserve accounts may be purchased  by  the  purchaser(s)  or  transferee(s)  for  an  amount  equal  to  the  reserve account(s) balance(s).\n\n- (A) The  minimum  replacement  reserve  deposit  for  projects  shall  be  three  hundred dollars  ($300)  per  unit  per  year,  or  for  new  construction  or  senior  projects,  two hundred  fifty  dollars  ($250)  per  unit  per  year.  The  on-going  funding  of  the replacement  reserve  in  this  amount  shall  be  a  requirement  of  the  regulatory agreement during the term of the agreement, and the owner shall maintain these reserves in a segregated account. Funds in the replacement reserve shall only be used for capital improvements or repairs.\n- (B) An  operating  reserve  shall  be  funded  in  an  amount  equal  to  three  months  of estimated  operating  expenses  and  debt  service  under  stabilized  occupancy. Additional funding will be required only if withdrawals result in a reduction of the operating reserve account balance to 50% or less of the originally funded amount. An equal, verified operating reserve requirement of any other debt or equity source may  be  used  as  a  substitute,  and  the  reserve  may  be  released  following achievement of a minimum annual debt service ratio of 1.15 for three consecutive years  following  stabilized  occupancy  only  to  pay  deferred  developer  fee.  The Committee shall allow operating reserve amounts in excess of industry norms to be considered 'reasonable costs,' for purposes of this subsection, only for homeless assistance  projects  under  the  Non-Profit  Set-Aside,  as  described  in  Section 10315(b), Special Needs projects, HOPE VI projects, or project-based Section 8 projects. The original Sources and Uses budget and the final cost certification shall demonstrate the initial and subsequent funding of the operating reserves.\n- (8) Applicant resources.  If the applicant intends to finance part or all of the project from its own resources or a Related Party's resources (other than deferred fees), the applicant shall be required to prove, to the Executive Director's satisfaction, that such resources are available and committed solely for this purpose, including an audited certification from a third party certified public accountant that applicant has sufficient funds to successfully accomplish the financing. Public entities are exempt from this requirement.\n- (9) Self-syndication.  If the applicant or a Related Party intends to be the sole or primary tax credit investor in a project, the project shall be underwritten using a tax credit factor (i.e., price) of $1 for each dollar of federal tax credit and $.79 dollars for each dollar of State Tax Credit, unless the applicant proposes a higher value.\n- (d) Determination  of  eligible  and  qualified  basis.    The  Committee  shall  provide  forms  to  assist applicants in determining basis.  The Committee shall rely on certification from an independent, qualified Certified Public Accountant for determination of basis; however, the Committee retains the right to disallow any basis it determines ineligible or inappropriate.\n- (1) High-Cost  Area  adjustment  to  eligible  basis.    Proposed  projects  located  in  a  qualified census tract or difficult development area, as defined in IRC Section 42(d)(5)(c)(iii), may qualify for a thirty percent (30%) increase to eligible basis, subject to Section 42, applicable California statutes and these regulations. Pursuant to Authority granted by IRC \u00a742(d)(5)(B)(v), CTCAC designates credit ceiling applications relating to sites that have lost their  difficult  development  area  or  qualified  census  tract  status  within  the  previous  12 months as a difficult development area (DDA).\n- (2) Pursuant  to  Authority  granted  by  IRC  \u00a742(d)(5)(B)(v),  CTCAC  designates  credit  ceiling applications  proposing  a  project  meeting  the  Special  Needs  housing  type  threshold requirements at Section 10325(g)(3) as a difficult development area (DDA).\n\n- (3) Pursuant  to  authority  granted  by  IRC  \u00a742(d)(5)(B)(v),  CTCAC  designates  credit  ceiling applications seeking state credits for which there are insufficient state credits as a difficult development area (DDA).\n- (4) Pursuant  to  authority  granted  by  IRC  \u00a742(d)(5)(B)(v),  CTCAC  designates  credit  ceiling applications for Federal Credit established by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 as a difficult development area (DDA).\n3. (e) Determination of Credit amounts.  The applicant shall determine, and the Committee shall verify, the maximum allowable Tax Credits and the minimum Tax Credits necessary for financial feasibility, subject to all conditions of this Section.  For purposes of determining the amount of Tax Credits, the project's qualified basis shall be multiplied by an applicable Credit percentage established by the Executive Director, prior to each funding cycle.  The percentage shall be determined taking into account recently published monthly Credit percentages.\n4. (f) Determination of feasibility.  To be considered feasible, a proposed project shall exhibit positive cash flow after debt service for a 15-year minimum term beginning at stabilized occupancy, or in the case of acquisition/rehabilitation projects, at the completion of rehabilitation.  'Cash flow after debt service' is defined as gross income (including (1) all rental income generated by proposed initial rent levels contained within the project application and (2) committed federal, state, and local rental subsidies; excluding income generated by tenant-based rental subsidies) minus vacancy, operating expenses, property taxes, service and site amenity expenses, operating and replacement reserves and must pay debt service (not including residual receipts debt payments).  Expenses that do not continue through all 15 years of the pro forma shall be excluded from the evaluation of feasibility  as  well  as  from  the  minimum  debt  service  coverage  ratio  and  cash  flow  parameters pursuant to Section 10327(g)(6). For applications that qualify for a reservation of Tax Credits: (1) from  the  Nonprofit  set-aside  homeless  assistance  apportionment,  (2)  with  special  needs  units comprising at least 25% of the low-income units, or (3) with an average targeted affordability of 40% of AMI or less, capitalized operating reserves in excess of the 3-month minimum amount  may be added to gross income for purposes of determining 'cash flow after debt service.' In addition, applications with a committed capitalized operating subsidy reserve from HCD, CalHFA, or another public entity approved by the Executive Director may add withdrawals from this reserve to gross income for purposes of determining 'cash flow after debt service.'\n5. (g) Underwriting criteria.  The following underwriting criteria shall be employed by the Committee in a pro forma analysis of proposed project cash flow to determine the minimum Tax Credits necessary for financial feasibility and the maximum allowable Tax Credits. The Committee shall allow initial applicants to correct cash flow shortages or overages up to the higher of $25,000 or 0.5% of gross income at placed in service.  In addition, if the operating expenses are below the published amount pursuant to subparagraph (1), the CTCAC Executive Director may correct the error by increasing the operating expenses to the published amount, provided the increase maintains compliance with all other feasibility and underwriting criteria.\n- (1) The 15-year pro forma revenue and expense projection calculations shall utilize a two-andone-half  percent  (2.5%)  increase  in  gross  income,  a  three-and-one-half  percent  (3.5%) increase  in  operating  expenses  (excluding  operating  and  replacement  reserves  set  at prescribed amounts), and a two percent (2%) increase in property taxes.\n7. (A) Where a private conventional lender and project equity  partner  use  a  2%  gross income and 3% operating expense increase underwriting assumption, CTCAC shall accept this methodology as well.\n8. (B) For projects with a HUD rental subsidy that will receive a subsidy layering review from  CTCAC,  CTCAC  shall  accept  2%  gross  income,  3%  operating  expense increase, and 7% vacancy underwriting assumptions.\n\nFor  purposes  of  the  pro  forma  projections  only,  the  application  form  Subsidy  Contract Calculation may utilize post-rehabilitation rental subsidy contract rent assumptions when applicable.\n\nMinimum operating expenses shall include expenses of all manager units and market rate units and must be at least equal to the minimum operating expense standards published by the Committee staff annually.  The published minimums shall be established based upon periodic  calculations  of  operating  expense  averages  annually  reported  to  CTCAC  by existing tax credit property operators.  The minimums shall be displayed by region, and project type (including large family, senior, and Special Needs), and shall be calculated at the reported average or at some level discounted from the reported average.  The Executive Director may, in his/her sole discretion, utilize operating expenses up to 15% less than required in this subsection for underwriting when the equity investor and the permanent lender are in place and provide evidence that they have agreed to such lesser operating expenses.  These minimum operating expenses do not include property taxes, replacement reserves, depreciation or amortization expense, compliance monitoring or lender fees, or the costs of any site or service amenities.\n\nSpecial needs projects that are less than 100% special needs shall prorate the operating expense minimums, using the special  needs  operating  expenses  for  the  special  needs units, and the other applicable operating expense minimums for the remainder of the units.\n\n- (2) Property  tax  expense  minimums  shall  be  one  percent  (1%)  of  total  replacement  cost, unless:\n2.

Vacancy and collection loss rates shall be between five and ten percent (5-10%) for special needs units and non-special needs SRO units with a significant project-based public rental subsidy. Vacancy and collection loss rates shall be five percent (5%) for all other units.\n- (4) Loan terms, including interest  rate,  length  of  term,  and  debt  service  coverage,  shall  be evidenced as achievable and supported in the application, or applicant shall be subject to the prevailing loan terms of a lender selected by the Committee.\n- (5) Variable interest rate permanent loans shall be considered at the underwriting interest rate, or, alternatively, at the permanent lender's underwriting rate upon submission of a letter from the lender indicating the rate used by it to underwrite the loan.  All permanent loan commitments with variable interest rates must demonstrate that a 'ceiling' rate is included in  the  loan  commitment  or  loan  documentation.    If  not,  the  permanent  loan  will  not  be accepted by CTCAC as a funding source.\n- (6) Minimum and Maximum Debt Service Coverage.

The new regulatory agreement shall reflect the current tax credit rent limits, but the project may continue to charge hold harmless HERA rents for units targeted below the elected federal set-aside (i.e., 40% of units at 60% AMI or 20% of units at 50% AMI) provided that the hold harmless rents do not exceed the rent level for the applicable elected federal set-aside and only until such time as the current tax credit rent limits equal or exceed the hold harmless rents.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.

All reservations of Tax Credits shall be conditioned upon:\n- (1) timely project completion;\n- (2) receipt of amounts of Tax Credits no greater than necessary for financial feasibility and viability as a qualified low-income housing project throughout the extended use period;\n- (3) income targets as proposed in the application; and,\n\n- (4) the rent increase limit rules in Section 10336(a).\n2. (b) Preliminary reservations.  Preliminary reservations of Tax Credits shall be subject to conditions as described  in  this  subsection  and  applicable  statutes.    Reservations  of  Tax  Credits  shall  be conditioned upon the Committee's receipt of the performance deposit described in Section 10335 and  an  executed  reservation  letter  bearing  the  applicant's  signature  accepting  the  reservation within  twenty  (20)  calendar  days  of  the  Committee's  notice  to  the  applicant  of  the  preliminary reservation, except that Hybrid projects and simultaneous phased projects as defined in Section 10327(c)(2)(C) shall submit the acceptance of the reservation for the first application within five (5) business days of the Committee's notice to the applicant of the reservation for the corresponding second application.  However, should the 20-day period for returning the executed reservation letter continue past December 15 of any year, an applicant may be required to execute and return the reservation letter in less than twenty (20) days in order that the reservation be effective.  Failure to comply with any shortened period would invalidate the reservation offer and permit the Committee to offer a reservation to the next eligible project.\n3. (c) Except for those applying under section 10326 of these regulations, applicants receiving a Credit reservation but who did not receive maximum points in the Readiness to Proceed point category shall provide the Committee with a completed updated application form no later than 180 days or 194 days, as applicable, following Credit reservation and start construction no later than 12 months following  Credit  reservation.  Failure  to  start  construction  within  12  months  following  Credit reservation may result in rescission of Credit reservation.\n4. Upon receipt of the updated application form, the Committee shall conduct a financial feasibility and cost reasonableness analysis for the proposed project and determine if all conditions of the preliminary reservation have been satisfied. Substantive changes to the approved application, in particular, changes to the financing plan or costs, need to be explained by the applicant in detail, and may cause the project to be reconsidered by the Committee.\n5. (d) Carryover  Allocations.    Except  for  those  applying  under  section  10326  of  these  regulations, applicants  receiving  a  Credit  reservation  shall  satisfy  either  the  Placed-in-service  requirements pursuant to subsection 10322(i) or carryover allocation requirements in the year the reservation is made, pursuant to IRC Section 42(h)(1)(E) and these regulations, as detailed below.  An application for a carryover allocation must be submitted no later than 20 days following the Credit reservation date, together with the applicable allocation fee, and all required documentation, except that the time for meeting the '10% test' and submitting related documentation, and owning the land, will be no later than twelve (12) months after the date of the carryover allocation. An application for a carryover allocation and allocation fee for the first application of a Hybrid project or a simultaneous phased project as defined in Section 10327(c)(2)(C) shall be submitted within five (5) business days of the Committee's notice to the applicant of the reservation for the corresponding second application.\n- (1) Additional documentation and analysis.  The Executive Director may request, and the holder of a Credit reservation shall provide, additional documentation required for processing a carryover allocation.\n- (2) In  addition  to  the  requirements  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  to  receive  a  carryover allocation an applicant shall provide evidence that applicant has maintained site control from the time of the initial application and, if the land is not already owned, will continue to maintain site control until the time for submitting evidence of the land's purchase.\n- (3) Certification.  The Committee shall require a certification from an applicant that has received a  reservation,  that  the  facts  in  the  application  continue  to  be  true  before  a  carryover allocation is made.\n9. (e) Placed-in-service.  The applicant shall submit documentation required by Section 10322(i).\n\n- (f) Additional  Conditions  to  Reservations  and  Allocations  of  Tax  Credits.    Additional  conditions, including cancellation, disqualification and other sanctions may be imposed by the Committee in furtherance of the purposes of the Tax Credits programs, including any remedial actions imposed on  Tax  Credit  recipients  under  sections  14052  and  14053  of  title  2  of  the  California  Code  of Regulations.\n- (g) Reservation Exchange.  A project with a reservation of Federal Credit pursuant to Section 10325 and a carryover allocation pursuant to Section 10328(d) and IRC Code \u00a7 42(h)(1)(E) that meets any of the following criteria may elect to return all of the Federal Credit in exchange for a new reservation  and  allocation  of  Federal  Credits.    The  reservation  and  carryover  allocation  of  the Federal Credits returned pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed cancelled by mutual consent pursuant  to  a  written  agreement  executed  by  the  Committee  and  the  applicant  specifying  the returned credit amount and the effective date on which the credits are deemed returned.  The Committee  shall  concurrently  issue  a  new  reservation  of  Federal  Credits  to  the  project  in  the amount of the Federal Credits returned by the project to the Committee.\n- (1) A High-Rise Project that returns all of the Federal Credit only during January of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the initial reservation and carryover allocation were made.\n- (2) A project that prior to the placed-in-service deadline merits additional time to place in service when development was significantly delayed during construction due to physical damage to the development directly caused by a disaster, including but not limited to, fires, floods, or earthquakes. In considering a request the Executive Director may consider at their sole discretion, among other things, the extent of the damage, the length of the delay, the time remaining until the project's placed in service deadline, and the circumstances causing the physical damage.\n- (3) A project reserved Federal credit established by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 or the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 that returns all of the Federal Credit only during January of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the initial reservation and carryover allocation were made.\n- (4) A Waiting List project that returns all of the Federal Credit only during the calendar year immediately  following  the  calendar  year  in  which  the  initial  reservation  and  carryover allocation were made.\n- (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (4), a Waiting List project that returns all of the Federal Credit prior to December 31, 2023, immediately following when the initial reservation and carryover allocation were made.\n- (6) A project reserved and allocated Federal Credit that returns all of the Federal Credit due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control and subject to the prior written approval of the Executive Director at their sole discretion.\n- (h) CTCAC may contract with accountants and contractors or construction engineers to review the accuracy and reasonableness of a subset of final cost certifications submitted each year.  The owner of a project selected for review and the accountant who prepared the final cost certification for such a project shall provide all requested information and generally facilitate the review.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.\n\nReference: Sections 12206, 17058 and 23610.5, Revenue and Taxation Code; and Sections 50199.4, 50199.5,  50199.6,  50199.7,  50199.8,  50199.9,  50199.10,  50199.11,  50199.12,  50199.13,  50199.14, 50199.15, 50199.16, 50199.17, 50199.18, 50199.20, 50199.21 and 50199.22, Health and Safety Code.",

This fee shall be paid to the Committee and shall be submitted with the application.  This fee is not refundable.  Applicants reapplying in the same calendar year  for  an  essentially  similar  project  on  the  same  project  site  shall  be required to pay an additional $1,500 filing fee to be considered in a subsequent funding round, regardless of whether any amendments are made to the re-filed application.  At the request of the applicant and upon payment of the applicable fee by the application filing deadline, applications remaining on file will be considered as is, or as amended, as of the date of a reservation cycle deadline.  It is the sole responsibility of the applicant to amend its application prior to the reservation cycle deadline to meet all application requirements of these regulations, and to submit a 'complete' application in accordance with Section 10322. $1,000  of  the  initial  application  filing  fee  shall  be  provided  to  each  official  LRA  which completes a project evaluation for the Committee.  A LRA may waive its portion of the application filing fee.  Such waiver shall be evidenced by written confirmation from the LRA, included with the application.\n- (b) Allocation fee.  Every applicant who receives a reservation of Tax Credits, except tax-exempt bond project applicants, shall be required to pay an allocation fee equal to four percent (4%) of the dollar amount of the first year's Federal Credit amount reserved.  Reservations of Tax Credits shall be conditioned  upon  the  Committee's  receipt  of  the  required  fee  paid  to  the  Committee  prior  to execution of a carryover allocation or issuance of tax forms, whichever comes first.  This fee is not refundable.\n- (c) Appeal fee.  Any applicant submitting an appeal to the Committee shall pay a fee of five hundred dollars ($500) to CTCAC. The fee must accompany the appeal letter to the Committee.\n- (d) Reservation  fee.    Tax-exempt  bond  project  applicants  receiving  Credit  reservations  shall  be required  to  pay  a  reservation  fee  equal  to  one  percent  (1%)  of  the  annual  Federal  Tax  Credit reserved.  Reservations of Tax Credits shall be conditioned upon the Committee's receipt of the required fee within twenty (20) days of issuance of a tax-exempt bond reservation, except that Hybrid  projects  and  simultaneous  phased  projects  as  defined  in  Section  10327(c)(2)(C)  shall submit the reservation fee for the first application within five (5) business days of the Committee's notice to the applicant of the reservation for the corresponding second application, or prior to the issuance of tax forms, whichever is first.\n- (e) Performance deposit.  Each applicant receiving a preliminary reservation of Federal, or Federal and State (including State Farmworker), Tax Credits shall submit a performance deposit equal to four percent (4%) of the first year's Federal Credit amount reserved, but not to exceed $100,000, including applicants with a reservation of credit on or after October 14, 2020.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, an applicant requesting Federal Tax Credits not subject to the Federal housing Credit Ceiling and requesting State Tax Credits or State Farmworker Tax Credits, shall be required to submit a performance deposit in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the first year's State Credit amount  reserved  for  the project, but not  to  exceed  $100,000. Notwithstanding  the  other  provisions  of  this  Section,  an  applicant  requesting  only  Federal  Tax Credits not subject to the Federal Credit Ceiling, shall not be required to submit a performance deposit.\n\n- (1) Timing and form of payment.  The performance deposit shall be paid to the Committee within twenty (20) calendar days of the Committee's notice to the applicant of a preliminary reservation, except that Hybrid projects and simultaneous phased projects as defined in Section 10327(c)(2)(C) shall submit the performance deposit for the first application within five (5) business days of the Committee's notice to the applicant of the reservation for the corresponding second application.\n- (2) Returned Tax Credits.  If Tax Credits are returned after a reservation has been accepted, the performance deposit is not refundable, with the following exceptions.  Projects unable to proceed due to a natural disaster, a lawsuit, or similar extraordinary circumstance that prohibits project development may be eligible for a refund.  Requests to refund a deposit shall  be  submitted  in  writing  for  Committee  consideration.    Amounts  not  refunded  are forfeited  to  the  Committee.    All  forfeited  funds  shall  be  deposited  in  the  occupancy compliance  monitoring  account  to  be  used  to  help  cover  the  costs  of  performing  the responsibilities described in Section 10337.\n- (3) Refund or forfeiture.  To receive a full refund of the performance deposit, the applicant shall do all of the following:  place the project in service under the time limits permitted by law; qualify the project as a low-income housing project as described in Section 42; meet all the conditions under which the reservation of Tax Credits was made; certify to the Committee that the Tax Credits allocated will be claimed; and, execute a regulatory agreement for the project.  If the Committee cancels a Credit because of misrepresentation by the applicant either before or after an allocation is made, the performance deposit is not refundable.  If the project is completed, but does not become a qualified low-income housing project, the performance deposit is not refundable.\n- (4) Appeals.  An applicant may appeal the forfeiture of a performance deposit, by submitting in writing, a statement as to why the deposit should be refunded.  The appeal shall be received by the Committee not later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of mailing by the Committee of the action from which the appeal is to be taken.  The Executive Director shall review the appeal, make a recommendation to the Committee, and submit the appeal to the Committee for a decision.\n5. (f) Compliance monitoring fee.  The Committee shall charge a $700 per low-income unit fee to cover the costs associated with compliance monitoring throughout the extended-use period.  Generally, payment  of  the  fee  shall  be  made  prior  to  the  issuance  of  Federal  and/or  State  tax  forms. Assessment of a lesser fee, and any alternative timing for payment of the fee, may be approved at the sole discretion of the Executive Director and shall only be considered where convincing proof of  financial  hardship  to  the  owner  is  provided.    Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  preclude  the Committee  from  charging  an  additional  fee  to  cover  the  costs  of  any  compliance  monitoring required, but an additional fee shall not be required prior to the end of the initial 15 year compliance period.\n6. (g) Tax form revision fee. An owner who requests an amendment to 8609 or 3521A tax forms, including a request that occurs after CTCAC completes the drafting of these forms, shall pay a fee of $1000 unless the Executive Director determines that the amendment is necessary due to a CTCAC error.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.

All recipients of Tax Credits, whether Federal only, or both Federal and State, are required to execute a regulatory agreement, as a condition to the Committee's making an allocation, which will be recorded against the property for which the Tax Credits are allocated, and, if applicable, will reflect all scoring criteria proposed by the applicant in the competition for Federal and/or State housing Credit Ceiling.\n- (1) For all  projects  receiving  a  reservation  of  competitive  9% federal tax credits on or after January 1, 2016 for which all general partners will be Qualified Nonprofit Organizations, the partnership agreement shall include a Right of First Refusal ('ROFR') for one or more of the nonprofit general partners to purchase the project after the end of the 15-year federal compliance period. The price to purchase the project under this ROFR shall be the minimum price allowed under IRC Section 42(i) plus any amounts required to be paid to the tax credit investors that remain unpaid for approved Asset Management Fees and required payments under the limited partnership agreement for tax credit adjusters that remain outstanding at the time of the sale. The applicant shall demonstrate compliance with this requirement prior to the issuance of the 8609 forms.\n- (2) For all projects receiving a reservation of 4% and 9% federal tax credits on or after January 1, 2016, the regulatory agreement shall require written approval of the Executive Director for any Transfer Event.\n- (3) Where  a  Project  is  receiving  renewable  project-based  rental  assistance  or  operating subsidy:\n- (A) the owner shall in good faith apply for and accept all renewals available;\n- (B) if the project-based rental assistance or operating subsidy is terminated through no fault of the owner, the property owner shall notify CTCAC in writing immediately and shall make every effort to find alternative subsidies or financing structures that would maintain the deeper income targeting contained in the recorded CTCAC regulatory agreement.    Upon  documenting  to  CTCAC's  satisfaction  unsuccessful  efforts  to identify and obtain alternative resources, the owner may increase rents and income targeting for Low-Income Units above the levels allowed by the recorded regulatory agreement up to the federally-permitted maximum. Rents shall be raised only to the extent required for Financial Feasibility, as determined by CTCAC.  Where possible, remedies shall include skewing rents higher on portions of the project in order to preserve  affordability  for  units  regulated  by  CTCAC  at  extremely  low  income targeting.  Any necessary rent increases shall be phased in as gradually as possible, consistent with maintaining the project's Financial Feasibility.  If housing Special Needs  populations,  the  property  owner  shall  attempt  to  minimize  disruption  to existing  households,  and  transition  to  non-Special  Needs  households  only  as necessary and upon vacancy whenever possible.\n- (4) All projects that receive a reservation of Tax Credits on or after January 1, 2017 and that involve a leasehold interest shall, in addition to the regulatory agreement, execute a lease rider which shall be recorded in the County Recorder's Office for which the project is located.\n\n- (b) Responsibility of owner.\n- (1) Compliance.    All  compliance  requirements  monitored  by  the  Committee  shall  be  the responsibility of the project owner.  Project owners are required to annually certify tenant incomes  in  conformance  with  IRS  regulation  \u00a71.42-5(c)(3)  unless  the  project  is  a  100 percent (100%) tax credit property exempted under IRC Section 142(d)(3)(A).  Owners of a 100% tax credit property must perform a first annual income recertification in addition to the required  initial  move-in  certification.    After  initial  move-in  certification  and  first  annual recertification,  owners  of  100%  tax  credit  properties  may  discontinue  obtaining  income verifications.  Owners of 100% tax credit properties must continue to check for full-time student status of all households during the entire tenancy of the households and throughout the initial compliance period, and continue recordkeeping in accordance with paragraph (1) of  this  subsection.    These  requirements  continue  if  the  tax  credit  property  is  sold, transferred, or under new management.  Any failure by the owner to respond to compliance reports and certification requirements will be considered an act of noncompliance and shall be reported to the IRS if reasonable attempts by the Committee to obtain the information are unsuccessful.\n- (2) Homeless youth and federal student rule. After the 15-year federal compliance period has lapsed, units in a special needs project designated at reservation for homeless youth may be occupied entirely by full-time students who are not dependents of another individual.\n- (3) Prohibition against requiring tenants to participate in services. All new and existing Tax Credit projects are prohibited from requiring tenants to participate in services, unless the tenant occupies a unit assisted with a federal source that requires tenant participation in services.\n- (c) Compliance monitoring procedure.  As required by Section 42(m), allocating agencies are to follow a compliance monitoring procedure to monitor all Credit projects for compliance with provisions of Section 42.  Compliance with Section 42 is the sole responsibility of the owner of the building for which the Credit is allowable.  The Committee's obligation to monitor projects for compliance with the  requirements  of  Section  42  does  not  place  liability  on  the  Committee  for  any  owner's noncompliance, nor does it relieve the owner of its responsibility to comply with Section 42. In addition  to  the  requirements  set  forth  in  CTCAC's  Compliance  Manual,  available  on  CTCAC's website (https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/compliance/manual.asp) and incorporated herein by reference, owners must comply with the following:\n- (1) Record keeping.  The owner of a Credit project is required to keep records for each qualified low income building in the project for each year in the compliance period showing: the total number of residential rental units in the building (including the number of bedrooms, and unit  size  in  square  feet);  the  percentage  of  Low-Income  and  Market  Rate  Units  in  the building that are Low-Income Units; the rent charged for each Low-Income Unit; a current utility  allowance  as  specified  in  26  CFR  Section  142.10(c)  and  Section  10322(h)(21)  of these regulations (for buildings using an energy consumption model utility allowance, that allowance must be calculated using the most recent version of the CUAC); the number of household members in each Low-Income Unit; notation of any vacant Low-Income Units; move-in  dates  for  all  Low-Income  Units;  low-income  tenants'  (i.e.,  household)  income; documentation to support each low-income household's income certification; the eligible basis and qualified basis of the building at the end of the first year of the Credit period; and, the character and use of any nonresidential portion of the building included in the building's eligible basis.\n\nUpon request, scattered site projects shall make these records available for inspection by CTCAC staff at a single location.\n\n- (2) Record Retention.  For each qualified low-income building in the project, and for each year of the compliance period, owners and the Committee are required to retain records of the information described above in 'record keeping requirements.'\n\n- (A) Owners shall retain documents according to the following schedule:\n- (i) for  at  least  six  years  following  the  due  date  (with  extensions)  for  filing  the Federal income tax return for that year (for each year except the first year of the Credit period); and,\n- (ii) for the first year of the Credit period, at least six years following the due date (with extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return for the last year of the compliance period of the building.\n- (iii) for local health, safety, or building code violation reports or notices issued by a state  or  local  governmental  entity,  until  the  Committee  has  inspected  the reports or notices and completes the tenant file and unit inspections, and the violation  has  been  corrected.    This  subsection  shall  take  effect  beginning January 1, 2001.\n- (B) The Committee shall retain records of noncompliance, or failure to certify, for at least six years beyond the Committee's filing of the respective IRS noncompliance Form 8823.  Should the Committee require submission of copies of tenant certifications and records, it shall retain them for three years from the end of the calendar year it receives them.  Should it instead review tenant files at the management office of the subject project, it shall retain its review notes and any other pertinent information for the  same  three-year  period.    The  Committee  shall  retain  all  other  project documentation for the same three-year period.\n- (3) Certification requirements.  Under penalty of perjury, a Credit project owner is required to annually, during each year of the compliance period, meet the certification requirements of U.S.  Treasury  Regulations  26  CFR  1.42-5(c),  (including  certifications  that  no  finding  of discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, 42 USC 3601 occurred for the project), that the buildings and low income units in the project were suitable for occupancy taking into account local health, safety, and building codes, that no violation reports were issued for any building or low income unit in the property by the responsible state or local government unit, that the owner did not refuse to lease a unit to an applicant because the applicant had a section 8 voucher or certificate, and that except for transitional or single room occupancy housing, all low income units in the project were used on a nontransient basis.  The following must also be certified to by the owner:\n- (A) the project met all terms and conditions recorded in its Regulatory Agreement, if applicable;\n- (B) the applicable fraction (as defined in IRC Section 42(c)(1)(B)) met all requirements of  the  Credit  allocation  as  specified  on  IRS  Form(s)  8609  (Low-Income  Housing Credit Allocation Certification.);\n- (C) no change in ownership of the project has occurred during the reporting period;\n- (D) the project has not been notified by the IRS that it is no longer a 'qualified lowincome housing project' within the meaning of Section 42 of the IRC;\n- (E) no additional tax-exempt bond funds or other Federal grants or loans with interest rates below the applicable Federal rate have been used in the Project since it was placed-in-service; and,\n- (F) report the number of units that were occupied by Credit eligible households during the reporting period.\n\n- (G) the services specified in the Regulatory Agreement were provided to the tenants during the reporting period.\n- (H) if the project is subject to a cash flow limitation in its Regulatory Agreement, that the limitation has been met.\n- (I) the  project  complied  with  local,  state,  and  federal  laws,  constitutions,  codes, standards, rules, guidelines, and regulations, including, without limitation, those that pertain  to  accessibility,  construction,  health  and  safety,  labor,  fair  housing,  fair employment practices, affirmatively furthering fair housing, nondiscrimination, and equal opportunity and is not the subject of any regulatory or investigative proceeding by  a  local,  state,  or  federal  agency  relating  to  an  alleged,  pending,  ongoing,  or closed violation of the Fair Housing Laws.\n- (4) Status report, file and on site physical inspection.  The Committee or its agent will conduct file  and  on  site  physical  inspections  for  all  projects  no  later  than  the  end  of  the  second calendar year following the year the last building in the project is placed-in-service, and once every three years thereafter.  These physical inspections will be conducted for all buildings and common areas in each project, and for at least 20% of the low-income units in each project.  The tenant file reviews will also be for at least 20% of the low-income units in each project, but may be conducted on site or off site.  Each year the Committee shall select projects for which site inspections will be conducted.  The projects shall be selected using guidelines established by the Executive Director for such purpose, while the units and tenant records to be inspected shall be randomly selected.  Advance notice shall not be given of the Committee's selection process, or of which tenant records will be inspected at selected projects; however, an owner shall be given reasonable notice prior to a project inspection.\n- (A) A Notice of Intent to Conduct Compliance Inspection and a Project Status Report (PSR) form will be delivered to the project owner within a reasonable period before an inspection is scheduled to occur.  The completed PSR form shall be submitted to the Committee by the owner prior to the compliance inspection.  The Committee will review the information submitted on the PSR for compliance with income, rent and other requirements prior to performing the tenant file inspection.\n- (B) Each project undergoing a file inspection will be subject to a physical inspection to assure  compliance  with  local  health,  safety,  and  building  codes  or  with  HUD's uniform physical condition standards.  Owners shall be notified of the inspection results.\n- (C) The  Committee  may  perform  its  status  report,  file  inspection  procedures  and physical  inspection  on  Credit  projects  even  if  other  governmental  agencies  also monitor those projects.  The Committee's reliance on other review findings may alter the extent of the review, solely at the Committee's discretion and as allowed by IRS regulations.  The Committee may rely on reports of site visits prepared by lenders or  other  governmental  agencies,  at  its  sole  discretion.    The  Committee  shall, whenever possible, coordinate its procedures with those of other agencies, lenders and investors.\n- (5) Notification of noncompliance.  The Committee shall notify owners in writing if the owner is required  to  submit  documents/information  related  to  either  the  physical  or  tenant  file inspection.  If the Committee does not receive the information requested, is not permitted or otherwise is unable to conduct the inspections or discovers noncompliance with Section 42 as a result of its review, the owner shall be notified in writing before any notice is sent to the IRS.\n- (6) Correction  period.    It  is  the  intention  of  the  Committee  that  owners  be  given  every reasonable  opportunity  to  correct  any  noncompliance.    Owners  shall  be  allowed  an\n\nopportunity to supply missing tenant file documents or to correct other noncompliance within a correction period no longer than ninety (90) days from the date of written notice by the Committee to the owner, unless the violation constitutes an immediate health or safety issue, in which case, the correction should be made immediately.  With good cause, the Committee may grant up to a six-month extension of the correction period upon receipt of a written justification from the owner.\n\n- (7) IRS and FTB notification.  All instances of noncompliance, whether corrected or not, shall be reported by the Committee to the IRS.  This shall be done within forty-five (45) days following the termination of a correction period allowed by the Committee, pertaining to IRS Form 8823.\n2. (d) Change in ownership and property management.  It is the project owner's responsibility to comply with the requirements of Section 10320(b) and to inform the Committee of any change in the project owner's mailing address.\n- (1) Any property management change during the 15-year federal compliance and extended use  period  must  be  to  a  party  earning  equal  capacity  points  pursuant  to  Section 10325(c)(1)(A) as the exiting property management company. At a minimum this must be six  (6)  projects  in  service  more  than  three  years,  or  the  demonstrated  training  required under Section 10326(g)(5).  Two of the six projects must be Low Income Housing Tax Credit projects  in  California.    If  the  new  property  management  company  does  not  meet  these experience requirements, then substitution of property management shall not be permitted.\n4. (e) First year's 8609.  Project owners shall be required to submit a copy of the executed first year's filing of IRS Form 8609 (Low-Income Housing Credit Allocation Certification) for inclusion in the Committee's permanent project records.\n5. (f) (1) CTCAC may establish a schedule of fines for violations of the terms and conditions, the regulatory  agreement,  other  agreements,  or  program  regulations.  In  developing  the schedule of fines, CTCAC shall establish the fines for violations in an amount up to five hundred dollars ($500) per violation or double the amount of the financial gain because of the violation, whichever is greater. Except for serious violations, a first-time property owner violator shall be given at least 30 days to correct the violation before a fine is imposed. A violation that has occurred for some time prior to discovery is one violation, but fines may be a recurring amount if the violation is not corrected within a reasonable period of time thereafter, as determined by the Committee.\n- (2) CTCAC shall adopt and may revise the schedule of fines by resolution at a public general Committee meeting.\n- (3) A person or entity  subject  to  a  fine  may  appeal  the  fine  to  the  Executive  Director  and, thereafter, to the Committee pursuant to Section 10330(b)(2).\n- (4) The Executive Director may approve a payment plan for any fines.\n- (5) If a fine assessed against a property owner is not paid within six months from the date when the fine was initially assessed and after reasonable notice has been provided to the property owner, the Committee may record a lien against the property.  If the violation(s) for which the fine(s) is assessed is not corrected within 90 days of the assessed fine, the Committee may record a lien against the property.\n- (6) Reoccurring  or  repeated  noncompliance  -  CTCAC  shall  issue  fines  of  up  to  $500  per instance of repeated or reoccurring noncompliance violations noted in separate monitoring cycles. CTCAC defines repeated or reoccurring violations as 25% or more instances of the current  monitoring  inspection  having  the  same  noncompliance  issues  as  found  in  the previous monitoring cycle.\n\nAreas of repeated or reoccurring noncompliance include (but are not limited to):\n\n- (A) Repeated  Uniform  Physical  Conditions  Standards  (UPCS)  Health  and  Safety Violations and Common Area Violations\n- (B) Reoccurring patterns of units no turn-key ready and advertised within 60 days of unit vacancy date\n- (C) Reoccurring patterns of missing or the incorrect use of required CTCAC forms\n- (D) Reoccurring misuse of Utility Allowance methods\n- (E) Reoccurring patterns of over-income households\n- (F) Reoccurring patterns of over-charged rents\n- (G) Reoccurring patterns of incomplete or missing re-certifications\n- (H) Service Amenities not provided within Federal Compliance periods\n- (g) Housing Supplier Diversity Reporting. A housing sponsor that receives a tax credit reservation on or after January 1, 2024, shall annually submit a report to CTCAC, in a form that CTCAC shall require, and at the time that CTCAC shall annually designate. The reporting period shall cover all contract activities directly related to the development and construction of a housing project from the first day following the credit reservation date with an option for the housing sponsor to include prior contracting activities. The final report shall cover the year that the project is placed in service. The report shall include information, as required in Section 50199.23 of the Health and Safety Code and as outlined in the CTCAC Housing Supplier Diversity Reporting Guidelines: Completing the Housing Supplier Diversity Annual Report.\n\nNote: Authority cited: Section 50199.17, Health and Safety Code.
