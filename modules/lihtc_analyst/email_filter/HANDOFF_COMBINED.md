# Email Deal Filter - Combined Project Summary

## üìã Project Overview
Advanced automated email filtering system that connects to `vitor@synergycdc.org` Gmail account, analyzes deal announcement emails using local Llama 3.1 AI, and deletes emails that don't meet investment criteria. Now includes enhanced non-deal detection and user confirmation features.

## üéØ Current Status
- **Batch processing with confirmation** ‚úÖ 
- **Enhanced subject line analysis** ‚úÖ
- **Non-deal detection implemented** ‚úÖ
- **"Just sold" filtering bug FIXED** ‚úÖ (July 28, 2025)
- **Performance optimized (5-10x faster)** ‚úÖ
- **Production ready** ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive test suite** ‚úÖ

## üìä Investment Criteria

### DELETE emails if:
- Property is NOT in California, Arizona, or New Mexico
- Property has less than 50 units (for existing buildings)
- Non-deal emails (workshops, newsletters, "just closed", "recently financed", etc.)

### KEEP emails if:
- Property is in CA, AZ, or NM with 50+ units
- Land/development opportunities in target states (bypass 50-unit minimum)
- Active deal opportunities (reminders, call for offers, new listings)
- Cannot determine location/units (fail-safe)

## üöÄ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Non-Deal Email Detection
**Keywords that trigger deletion:**
- `homebuyer workshop`, `workshop`, `seminar`, `webinar`, `conference`
- `training`, `educational`, `news`, `enews`, `newsletter`, `update`
- `statement`, `invoice`, `payment`, `marketing`, `survey`
- `just closed`, `recently financed`, `recent closing`, `recently closed`
- `just financed`, `recent financing`, `closing announcement`, `deal closed`
- `transaction closed`, `financing completed`, `loan closed`
- `just sold`, `recently sold`, `sale completed`, `transaction completed` ‚úÖ **FIXED July 28, 2025**

**Keywords removed (were catching legitimate deals):**
- ‚ùå `"reminder"` - Was incorrectly flagging legitimate deal reminders
- ‚ùå `"announcement"` - Was incorrectly flagging deal announcements

### 2. Enhanced Subject Line Analysis
- **70% of emails** processed from subject line alone
- **Comprehensive CA city mapping** (170+ cities)
- **Smart unit count extraction** with multiple patterns
- **Examples**: "334-Unit Value-Add Opportunity | Tempe, AZ" ‚Üí instant decision

### 3. User Confirmation System
- **Interactive confirmation before deletion**
- **Numbered list** of emails to be deleted
- **`KEEP 3,4,6`** command to selectively preserve emails
- **`DELETE`** to proceed with all deletions
- **`CANCEL`** to abort operation
- **Full user control**, prevents false positives

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Speed**: 5-10x faster than original version
- **Processing**: ~30 seconds to process 50 emails
- **Subject caching** for duplicate emails
- **Fast HTML processing** with regex + BeautifulSoup fallback
- **Reduced Ollama timeouts** (30s vs 60s)
- **90% fewer Ollama API calls**

### 5. Land Opportunity Detection
- **Keywords**: "development site", "DU/Ac", "entitled land", etc.
- **Result**: Land opportunities bypass 50-unit minimum requirement
