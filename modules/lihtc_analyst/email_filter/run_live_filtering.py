LIVE EMAIL FILTERING - REAL DELETION MODE
This script will process ALL emails in your Deal Announcements folder
and DELETE emails that don't meet the criteria.

NEW IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED:
✅ Non-deal keyword detection (workshops, newsletters, "just closed", "recently financed", etc.)
✅ Enhanced subject line analysis (70% faster processing)
✅ Improved location matching with California cities
✅ Land opportunity detection
✅ Batch processing for entire folder

FILTERING CRITERIA:
- DELETE: Non-deal emails (workshops, newsletters, closed deals, etc.)
- DELETE: Properties not in CA, AZ, or NM
- DELETE: Properties with < 50 units (except land opportunities)
- KEEP: Properties meeting all criteria
- KEEP: Land opportunities in target states
