# Email Deal Filter - Improvements Summary

## Overview
Created an improved version (`email_deal_filter_oauth_improved.py`) that addresses all four major issues identified in the handoff summary.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Subject Line Analysis
- **What it does**: Extracts location and unit count directly from email subjects
- **Benefits**: 
  - Many emails can be filtered without analyzing the body
  - Reduces Ollama API calls and processing time
  - Catches properties that were missed when body was HTML-only
- **Patterns detected**:
  - Unit counts: "6-Unit", "10 units", "150-unit", "45 Unit"
  - State abbreviations: "Phoenix, AZ", "in CA", "TX - "
  - City names: Maps major cities to states (Houston → Texas, Richmond → Virginia)

### 2. Improved HTML Email Parsing
- **What it does**: Uses BeautifulSoup4 to better extract content from HTML emails
- **Benefits**:
  - Extracts text more reliably from HTML-only emails
  - Captures link text and URLs that might contain property information
  - Handles emails that previously showed as "HTML-only" redirects
- **Requirements**: Added `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` to requirements.txt

### 3. Land Opportunity Detection
- **What it does**: Identifies development sites vs existing properties
- **Benefits**:
  - Land opportunities are NOT filtered by the 50-unit minimum
  - Correctly handles "33 DU/Ac" (density) vs "33 units" (actual count)
  - Preserves valuable development opportunities
- **Keywords detected**: 
  - "development site", "land opportunity", "entitled"
  - "DU/Ac", "units per acre", "zoned for"
  - "raw land", "vacant land", "ground-up"

### 4. Fixed Location Matching
- **What it does**: Uses smarter regex patterns with word boundaries
- **Benefits**:
  - No more false positives ("PE" matching Pennsylvania, "SCAM" matching South Carolina)
  - Correctly identifies state abbreviations only in proper contexts
  - City-to-state mapping for common cities
- **Matching order**:
  1. Known city names (Houston, Richmond, Des Moines, etc.)
  2. Full state names (California, Arizona, New Mexico)
  3. State abbreviations with proper context (after comma, at end, etc.)

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- Missing small properties in HTML emails
- False positives on state matching
- Deleting valuable land opportunities
- Processing every email through Ollama

### After
- Catches properties from subject lines alone
- Accurate state detection
- Preserves land/development opportunities
- Skips Ollama when subject has sufficient info

## Usage

```bash
# Install new dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run improved version (dry run by default)
python3 email_deal_filter_oauth_improved.py

# Test the improvements without real emails
python3 test_improvements.py
```

## Testing Results

The test script demonstrates:
- ✓ Correctly identifies CA/AZ/NM properties to keep
- ✓ Correctly identifies out-of-state properties to delete
- ✓ Correctly identifies small properties (<50 units) to delete
- ✓ Correctly preserves land opportunities regardless of density
- ✓ No false positives on state abbreviations

## Next Steps

1. Run in dry-run mode first to verify improvements
2. Monitor the "Analysis Source" field to see how many emails are filtered by subject alone
3. Consider adding more city-to-state mappings as needed
4. Could add caching to avoid re-analyzing emails
