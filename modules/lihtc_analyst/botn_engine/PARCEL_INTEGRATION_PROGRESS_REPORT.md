# üèõÔ∏è COLOSSEUM PARCEL INTEGRATION PROGRESS REPORT

**Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Session**: Bill & Vitor Strategic Planning Session  
**Objective**: Integrate parcel corner mapping with BOTN CoStar data

---

## üìä Session Summary

### Initial Request
Integrate Bill's mapping code to:
1. Map all 4 corners of each parcel from CoStar sites
2. Utilize California parcel datasets (10M+ parcels)
3. Add CTCAC scoring from Perris modeling code

### Key Files Identified
- **CoStar Data**: `/modules/lihtc_analyst/botn_engine/Sites/CostarExport-15.xlsx`
  - Contains 153 sites across Northern California
  - Has Latitude/Longitude columns for each site
  - Includes County Name, City, State columns
  
- **Parcel Mapping Code**: 
  - `universal_parcel_mapper.py` - Has both Texas and California parcel APIs
  - `extract_dmarco_parcel_corners.py` - Example of corner extraction
  - `enhanced_ctcac_amenity_mapper.py` - CTCAC scoring rules

### California Parcel Datasets Available
- **19 Counties** with various formats (GeoJSON, CSV, Shapefile)
- Counties include: Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Fresno, Sacramento, Alameda, etc.

### Progress Made

#### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Created Integration Scripts**:
   - `colosseum_integrated_parcel_analysis.py` - Initial version using external APIs
   - `colosseum_local_parcel_analyzer.py` - Updated to use local datasets

2. **Identified Data Structure**:
   - CoStar sites are in Northern California (Shasta, Butte, Siskiyou, Nevada, Yuba counties)
   - Each site has precise Latitude/Longitude coordinates
   - Local parcel data exists but needs proper county mapping

3. **Preservation Strategy**:
   - Original CoStar data preserved in separate Excel sheet
   - Enhanced data adds parcel corners without overwriting

#### üîÑ In Progress
1. **County Mapping Issue**:
   - Initial county bounds dictionary didn't include Northern California counties
   - Need to use actual County Name from CoStar file instead of coordinate bounds
   - Should load parcel data based on county names directly

2. **Next Steps Identified**:
   - Use Latitude/Longitude from CoStar to find parcels
   - Extract all corner coordinates from parcel geometry
   - Create visualization outputs (KML files)
   - Add CTCAC scoring integration

### Technical Approach
```python
# Correct approach identified:
1. Read CoStar Excel ‚Üí Get Lat/Long and County Name
2. Load county parcel dataset (GeoJSON/Shapefile)
3. Find parcel containing the point (Lat/Long)
4. Extract all corner coordinates from parcel geometry
5. Output enhanced Excel with:
   - Original CoStar data (preserved)
   - Parcel corners for each site
   - CTCAC scoring framework
```

### Key Insights
- Don't need address matching - use Lat/Long directly
- County names in CoStar match our dataset folder names
- Each parcel can have many corners (not just 4)
- Need to handle both GeoJSON and Shapefile formats

### Output Format
Enhanced Excel with multiple sheets:
1. **Original_CoStar_Data** - Untouched original data
2. **Enhanced_Site_Summary** - Sites with parcel info
3. **Parcel_Corner_Coordinates** - All corners for each parcel
4. **CTCAC_Scoring** - Scoring framework (to be implemented)
5. **Analysis_Summary** - Statistics and metrics

### Issues to Resolve
1. Need to add Northern California counties to lookup
2. Some parcels may be in counties we don't have data for
3. CTCAC scoring integration still pending

## üéØ Ready for Next Phase
The foundation is built. Next step is to fix the county lookup to use actual county names from CoStar file and complete the parcel corner extraction for all 153 sites.
