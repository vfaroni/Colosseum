## üìã **TDHCA RESEARCH COMPLETED**

### **4% Tax-Exempt Bond Deals**
**Status**: Non-competitive threshold compliance system
**Key Requirements**:
- QCT/DDA federal basis boost (30% - CRITICAL)
- One Mile Three Year Rule (fatal flaw)

**Key Requirements**:
- All 4% requirements PLUS competitive scoring
- Two Mile Same Year Rule (large counties: Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, Collin, Denton)
- Same census tract exclusion (one development per tract)
- Low poverty bonus: 2 points for ‚â§20% poverty census tracts
- Opportunity Index: 7 points available

**Research Gaps**: Exact competitive scoring thresholds, specific financial requirements

### **Fatal Flaw Rules (BINARY ELIMINATION)**
```
One Mile Three Year Rule:
- No LIHTC within 5,280 feet in last 3 years
- Applies to both 4% and 9% deals
- FATAL FLAW: Eliminates from consideration

Two Mile Same Year Rule:
- No multiple allocations within 10,560 feet same year  
- Large counties only (population >1M)
- 9% deals confirmed, 4% application unclear
```

## üé® **ECONOMIC VIABILITY METHODOLOGY**

### **Construction Cost Modeling**
```
Base Cost: $150/SF (Texas 2025 average)

Location Modifiers:
- Austin MSA: 1.20x ($180/SF)
- Houston MSA: 1.18x ($177/SF)  
- Dallas MSA: 1.17x ($176/SF)
- Fort Worth MSA: 1.15x ($173/SF)
- San Antonio MSA: 1.10x ($165/SF)
- Rural Areas: 0.95x ($143/SF)

FEMA Flood Adjustments:
- VE/V Zones: +30% (pile foundations, breakaway walls)
- AE/A Zones: +20% (elevation, flood venting)
- AO/AH Zones: +12% (minor elevation)
- X Zones: +5% (recommended elevation)
```

### **Revenue Calculation**
```
Density Assumptions:
- Urban: 30 units/acre
- Suburban: 20 units/acre  
- Rural: 15 units/acre

Revenue Formula:
Annual Revenue = HUD_2BR_60%_Rent √ó 12 √ó Density √ó Acres

Economic Score = Adjusted_Revenue_Per_Acre √∑ 10,000
Combined Score = (Land_Score √ó 0.4) + (Economic_Score √ó 0.6) + Penalties
```

### **Penalty System**
```
High Flood Risk (‚â•20% cost): -10 points
Low Rent Areas (<$1,000/month): -5 points
TDHCA Fatal Flaws: -20 points
```

## üìù **CRITICAL RESEARCH FINDINGS**

### **Low Poverty Bonus (2 Points)**
- **Requirement**: Census tract with ‚â§20% poverty rate
- **Application**: 9% competitive deals ONLY (not 4% deals)
- **Data Source**: Census ACS variable S1701_C03_001E
- **Implementation**: Always report actual poverty rate with bonus determination

### **Flood Zone Treatment**
- **TDHCA Scoring**: NO point penalties found in official scoring
- **Economic Impact**: Flood zones affect construction costs and insurance (2.5x-3.0x rates)
- **Approach**: Use as economic factor, not TDHCA scoring penalty

### **Same Census Tract Policy**
- **Current Rule**: "One development per census tract" (binary exclusion)
- **Historical**: Previous versions had graduated point scoring (0-5 or 6 points)
- **Implementation**: Binary rule rather than point scoring

### **4% vs 9% Deal Differences**
- **4% Focus**: Threshold compliance + economic feasibility (non-competitive)
- **9% Focus**: Full competitive scoring system (197 points available)
- **Site Scoring**: Different requirements - 9% has complex site-specific scoring

---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**

### **Sequential Analysis Approach**
```
Step 1: QCT/DDA Filter (BINARY - 30% basis boost required)
Step 2: Fatal Flaw Check (One Mile + Two Mile rules)
Step 3A: 9% TDHCA Scoring (including poverty bonus)
Step 3B: 4% Threshold Compliance  
Step 4: Economic Viability Analysis
Step 5: Combined Ranking and Recommendations
```

### **Deal Type Analysis Paths**

**9% Competitive Deals**:
```python
# Full competitive scoring approach
tdhca_score = calculate_9pct_scoring(property)
economic_score = calculate_economic_viability(property)  
combined_score = (tdhca_score * 0.6) + (economic_score * 0.4)
```

**4% Tax-Exempt Bond Deals**:
```python
# Threshold compliance + economic focus
threshold_pass = check_4pct_thresholds(property)
if threshold_pass:
    economic_score = calculate_economic_viability(property)
    rank_by_economics(property, economic_score)
```

### **Poverty Rate Reporting (ALWAYS)**
```python
def report_poverty_bonus(property_coords):
    tract_id = get_census_tract(property_coords)
    poverty_rate = get_poverty_rate(tract_id)
    
    print(f"Census Tract {tract_id}: {poverty_rate:.1f}% poverty rate")
    
    if poverty_rate <= 20.0:
        print("QUALIFIES for 2-point low poverty bonus (9% deals)")
        return 2
    else:
        print("Does not qualify for low poverty bonus")
        return 0
```

## üö® **CRITICAL UPDATE - EXPERT REVIEW REQUIRED CORRECTIONS**

**Post-Handoff Expert Critique Received**: A TDHCA expert identified **7 critical errors** in our methodology that require immediate correction before production use:

### **STOP - DO NOT USE CURRENT SYSTEM**
1. **QCT/DDA Error**: Treating as binary filter eliminates viable suburban sites
2. **One Mile Rule**: Incorrectly applied to 4% deals (should be soft risk only)
3. **Missing Scoring**: Opportunity Index (7pts), Local Gov (17pts), Lender Letter (26pts)
4. **Blended Scoring**: TDHCA awards use pure QAP points, not economic blending
5. **Other Critical Issues**: See `TDHCA_Corrections_from_Expert_Review.md`

### **Required Actions Before Production**
- ‚úÖ Remove QCT/DDA binary elimination 
- ‚úÖ Separate 4% and 9% One Mile Rule treatment
- ‚úÖ Add complete 2025 QAP scoring matrix (~170 points)
- ‚úÖ Separate TDHCA scoring from economic analysis
- ‚úÖ Validate against known TDHCA awards

**Document Classification**: Project Handoff - **REQUIRES CORRECTIONS**  
**Implementation Ready**: **NO - CORRECTIONS REQUIRED**  
**Priority**: Implement expert corrections before any production use
