## Project Overview
This is a Python-based LIHTC (Low-Income Housing Tax Credit) analysis system that processes affordable housing applications for California (CTCAC) and Texas (TDHCA). The system extracts data from Excel applications, performs scoring analysis, integrates flood risk assessments, and generates comprehensive reports.

## Key Architecture Components

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Excel/PDF Extraction** → Application data extraction from CTCAC/TDHCA forms
2. **Data Processing** → Scoring algorithms, tie-breaker analysis
3. **External API Integration** → Census API, HUD AMI data, FEMA flood data
4. **Report Generation** → Excel, HTML, JSON outputs

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: HUD AMI RENT CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### NEVER REPEAT THIS MISTAKE: Correct LIHTC Household Size Mapping
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT against Novogradac calculator (100% exact match)
**File**: `HUD2025_AMI_Rent_Data_Static.xlsx`
**Locations**: 
- Primary: `/Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/Bill Rice/Data_Sets/federal/HUD_AMI_Geographic/`
- Secondary: `/Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/Bill Rice/Structured Consultants/AI Projects/Lvg_Bond_Execution/Data Sets/HUD AMI FMR/`

#### ✅ CORRECT HUD/Novogradac Methodology:
```
Studio/Efficiency = 1.0 person
1BR = 1.5 persons (interpolate between 1 & 2 person income limits)
2BR = 3.0 persons (use 3-person income limit directly)
3BR = 4.5 persons (interpolate between 4 & 5 person income limits)  
4BR = 6.0 persons (use 6-person income limit directly)
```

#### ❌ WRONG INTERPRETATION (DO NOT USE):
- **1BR = 2.5 persons** (1 + 1×1.5) - WRONG!
- **2BR = 4.0 persons** (1 + 2×1.5) - WRONG!
- **3BR = 5.5 persons** (1 + 3×1.5) - WRONG!
- **4BR = 7.0 persons** (1 + 4×1.5) - WRONG!

#### Calculation Formula:
```python
# LIHTC Monthly Rent = (Annual Income Limit × 0.30) ÷ 12
# All rents MUST be rounded DOWN using math.floor()

# For fractional household sizes (1.5 and 4.5):
income_1p5 = income_1p + 0.5 * (income_2p - income_1p)  # Linear interpolation
income_4p5 = income_4p + 0.5 * (income_5p - income_4p)  # Linear interpolation
```

#### Verification Results:
- **Los Angeles County**: 20/20 exact matches with Novogradac (100%)
- **Multiple Major Metros**: Verified accurate across TX, IL, WA, FL, AZ
- **Source**: Official HUD 2025 MTSP income limits with verified methodology

#### Key Files:
- **Source Data**: `HUD 2025 AMI Section8-FY25.xlsx` (4,764 areas nationwide)
- **Processing Script**: `fix_correct_hud_methodology.py` (verified correct)
- **Verification Script**: `compare_novogradac.py` (proves 100% accuracy)

### Data Directories
- `state_flood_data/`: FEMA flood zone data (CA 100%, NM 100%, TX 78% geometry)
- `TDHCA_Analysis_Results/`: Texas analysis outputs
- `enhanced_texas_analysis/`: Enhanced analysis results

## Data Sources & Locations

### Data Sources
**Base Path**: `/Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/Bill Rice/Data_Sets`

**Key Datasets**:
- HUD QCT/DDA: `federal/HUD_QCT_DDA_Data/` (15,727 QCT + 2,958 DDA features)
- CA Transit: `california/CA_Transit_Data/` (22,510 HQTA areas, 264K+ stops)
- Schools: `california/CA_Public Schools/` and `texas/TX_Public_Schools/`
- FEMA Flood: `environmental/FEMA_Flood_Maps/` (CA/NM 100%, TX 78%)
- Cache: `cache/Cache/` (API responses, geocoding results)

## Common Development Tasks

### Running Extractors
Most extractors expect these parameters:
```python
input_path = '/Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/Bill Rice/Structured Consultants/AI Projects/CTCAC_RAG/raw_data'
output_path_4p = '.../JSON_data/4p'  # For 4% credit applications
output_path_9p = '.../JSON_data/9p'  # For 9% credit applications
log_path = '.../logs'
```

### Testing
Use `test_your_extractor.py` to test comprehensive extractors. No automated testing framework is configured.

### File Execution Pattern
Most scripts lack `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks. To run them:
1. Import the class/module
2. Initialize with required paths
3. Call `process_files()` or similar methods

### Cache Management
The system caches:
- Census API responses
- AMI lookups
- Geocoding results
Location: `/Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/Bill Rice/Structured Consultants/AI Projects/Lvg_Bond_Execution/Data Sets/Cache`

### CTCAC Regulation Research Process
**Quick Reference Guide for Regulatory Questions**:

1. **Use Task Tool for Complex Searches**: When searching for specific CTCAC regulatory requirements, use the Task tool to search through the processed data directory
2. **Key Section References**:
   - **Section 10325**: 9% competitive scoring and requirements (NOT applicable to MIP/4% deals)
   - **Section 10326**: 4% tax-exempt bond applications (includes MIP transactions)
   - **Section 10327**: Financial feasibility and DCR requirements (applies to both programs with variations)
3. **Critical Analysis Points**:
   - Section 10326(b) lists specific regulations that apply to tax-exempt bond projects
   - Regulations NOT listed in 10326(b) do NOT apply to MIP/4% transactions
   - Always verify program applicability before citing requirements
4. **Search Strategy**: Focus searches on section numbers, program types (9% vs 4%), and specific requirements (AMI, bedroom distribution, DCR, etc.)

## Analysis Best Practices

### Comprehensive Property Analysis Process
When analyzing LIHTC properties, follow this proven workflow:

1. **Property Documents Review**
   - Offering Memorandums, rent rolls, financial statements
   - Extract text from PDFs using PyPDF2 for analysis
   - Compare multiple years for trend analysis

2. **Market Context Analysis**
   - CoStar rent comparables (identify market position percentile)
   - Sales comparables (establish valuation benchmarks)
   - Operating expense comparables (validate efficiency)

3. **LIHTC Feasibility Components**
   - Federal designation checks (QCT/DDA for basis boost)
   - State-specific scoring (transit, opportunity areas, poverty rates)
   - AMI rent analysis with utility allowances
   - Welfare exemption opportunities (CA property tax savings)

4. **Financial Modeling**
   - Cash-on-cash returns with detailed assumptions
   - Sensitivity analysis across occupancy scenarios
   - 10-year projections with growth assumptions
   - Comparative analysis vs. market-rate alternatives

### Key California LIHTC Considerations
- **Welfare Exemption**: Can eliminate 1% ad valorem tax (~$240K annually on $24M property)
- **Opportunity Maps**: TCAC/HCD designations critical for 9% scoring
- **HQTA Analysis**: High Quality Transit Areas provide significant scoring advantages
- **Rent Stabilization**: Local ordinances may not apply to LIHTC but affect market comps

### Documentation Standards
- Create comprehensive markdown reports combining all analyses
- Include executive summaries with clear investment recommendations
- Provide detailed financial projections with assumptions documented
- Save analysis outputs in logical directory structure

- **`demo_compliance_conflict_detection.py`**: Demonstration of enhanced conflict detection capabilities

#### Key Compliance Categories
**🚨 Critical Violations**: State requirements that violate federal IRC Section 42 minimums
- AMI methodology not using HUD data (violates 26 CFR 1.42-9)
- Outdated applicable percentage rates (violates Revenue Procedure requirements)
- Insufficient compliance periods (violates IRC Section 42(i)(1))
- Non-compliant qualified basis calculations (violates IRC Section 42(c)(1))

**⬆️ State Enhancements**: State requirements exceeding federal minimums (COMPLIANT)
- Extended compliance periods (55 years vs 15-year federal minimum)
- Deeper affordability targeting (50% AMI vs 60% federal maximum)
- Additional competitive scoring criteria beyond federal requirements

**🔍 Investigation Required**: Areas needing federal vs state comparison
- Basis calculation items excluded by state vs federal inclusion
- AMI data source verification against federal requirements
- State scoring preferences vs federal non-discrimination rules
- Extended use period implementation vs federal 30-year minimum

**💰 Gap Funding Implications**: Funding needs created by state enhancements
- Operating subsidies for deeper affordability requirements
- Gap funding for state-excluded qualified basis items
- Long-term compliance and monitoring costs

#### Federal Compliance Framework
**Federal Requirements Analysis** (8 Core Areas):
1. **Compliance Period**: IRC Section 42(i)(1) - 15 years minimum
2. **Income Limits**: IRC Section 42(g)(1) - 60% AMI maximum
3. **Rent Limits**: IRC Section 42(g)(2) - 30% of AMI maximum  
4. **Qualified Basis**: IRC Section 42(c)(1) - Federal definition of eligible costs
5. **Applicable Percentage**: IRC Section 42(b) - Current federal rates
6. **AMI Methodology**: 26 CFR 1.42-9 - HUD data required
7. **Placed-in-Service**: IRC Section 42(h)(1)(E) - Federal deadlines
8. **Extended Use**: IRC Section 42(h)(6) - 30 years total requirement

#### Business Impact
**Risk Mitigation**:
- Early identification of federal compliance violations before application submission
- Prevention of credit recapture and allocation forfeiture (potential $millions in losses)
- Audit defense through documented compliance verification with authority citations

**Funding Strategy Intelligence**:
- Systematic identification of gap funding needs from state enhancements
- Strategic planning for operating subsidies required by deeper affordability
- Optimization of funding mix to support state requirements while maintaining federal compliance

**Compliance Scoring**: 0-100 point system with automatic deductions
- Critical violations: -25 points each (must fix immediately)
- Compliance risks: -10 points each (require verification)
- Investigation areas: -5 points each (need deeper analysis)
- State enhancements: No deduction (positive compliance indicators)

#### Production Capabilities
**Multi-State Analysis**: Simultaneous compliance analysis across all 51 jurisdictions
**Live Federal Updates**: Integration with federal RAG system for current requirements
**Automated Reporting**: Comprehensive compliance reports with specific action items
**Gap Funding Analysis**: Identification of funding sources for state enhancement requirements

#### Critical Compliance Principle
**States must comply with federal IRC Section 42 requirements** - State QAPs cannot contradict federal minimums but may:
- Add stricter requirements (requiring gap funding/subsidies)
- Extend compliance periods beyond federal minimums
- Include additional competitive scoring criteria
- Implement enhanced monitoring and reporting

Any state requirement that falls below federal minimums is flagged as a **CRITICAL VIOLATION** requiring immediate correction.
