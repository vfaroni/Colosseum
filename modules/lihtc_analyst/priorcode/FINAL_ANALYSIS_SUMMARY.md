## üîç **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: MSA AMI INFLATION**

### **Problem Identified**
The original analysis used HUD Area Median Income (AMI) rent limits as achievable revenue assumptions, but **rural sites within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) cannot achieve metro-area rent levels**. This created systematic over-valuation of rural investment opportunities.

### **Market Validation Study**
Using CoStar multifamily data (10+ unit properties) across 8 counties, we confirmed:

**Austin MSA Rural Sites** (Most Severe):
- **Bastrop County**: Market reality $1,214/month vs $1,600 assumed (-24%)
- **Caldwell County**: Market reality $1,026/month vs $1,600 assumed (-36%)
- **Impact**: Sites dropped from "Exceptional" to "Poor" rankings

**Dallas MSA Rural Sites** (Moderate):
- **Kaufman County**: Market reality $1,201/month vs $1,400 assumed (-14%)
- **Parker County**: Market reality $1,306/month vs $1,400 assumed (-7%)

**Houston MSA Rural Sites** (Significant):
- **Waller County**: Market reality $989/month vs $1,350 assumed (-27%)

### **Correction Applied**
- **MSA Rural Sites**: Applied realistic market rents with 10% LIHTC discount
- **Non-MSA Sites**: Preserved county AMI assumptions (appropriate for non-metropolitan areas)
- **Result**: 12 sites downgraded from "Exceptional" to "Poor" across both 4% and 9% deals
