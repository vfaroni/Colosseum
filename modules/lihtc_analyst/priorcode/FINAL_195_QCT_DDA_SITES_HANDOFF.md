## üîß **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Data Sources Integration**
1. **CoStar Sites (165)**: Complete commercial real estate data with broker contacts
2. **D'Marco Brent Sites (21)**: QCT/DDA filtered from 65 total broker opportunities  
3. **D'Marco Brian Sites (9)**: Additional QCT/DDA eligible development sites

### **Reference Data Dependencies**
- **TDHCA Regions**: `/TDHCA_RAG/TDHCA_Regions/TDHCA_Regions.xlsx` (254 counties)
- **HUD AMI Data**: `/Lvg_Bond_Execution/Data Sets/HUD AMI FMR/HUD2025_AMI_Rent_Data_Static.xlsx` (254 TX counties)
- **TDHCA Projects**: `/Lvg_Bond_Execution/Data Sets/State Specific/TX/Project_List/TX_TDHCA_Project_List_05252025.xlsx` (3,264 projects)

### **Key Technical Fix**
**Competition Detection**: Fixed en-dash character (‚Äê) issue in TDHCA `Longitude11` column that was preventing all distance calculations.

```python
# CRITICAL FIX
raw_projects['Longitude_Clean'] = pd.to_numeric(
    raw_projects['Longitude11'].astype(str).str.replace('‚Äê', '-', regex=False), 
    errors='coerce'
)
```

## üö® **KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: En-Dash Character in TDHCA Data**
**Problem**: Competition detection fails due to Unicode en-dash (‚Äê) in longitude data  
**Solution**: Applied in production code - converts en-dash to regular hyphen  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

### **Issue 2: Regional vs Local Market Classification**  
**Observation**: Rural sites in Region 7 show high rents due to Austin metro AMI  
**Explanation**: HUD AMI areas encompass entire metro regions  
**Business Value**: Identifies rural sites with metro-area rent potential  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING AS INTENDED**

### **Issue 3: Index_Right Column**
**Description**: Technical artifact from pandas merge operations  
**Business Impact**: None - can be ignored  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COSMETIC ONLY**

---

## üìà **BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE INSIGHTS**

### **Top Investment Opportunities**
1. **Region 2 Sites**: Highest revenue/cost ratio (0.094) in rural markets
2. **Region 10 Sites**: Strong performance (0.090) with lower competition
3. **Austin Metro Rural**: High AMI rents with rural development costs

### **Competition Risk Areas**
- **Region 3 (DFW)**: 59 sites but higher competition density
- **Region 6 (Houston)**: 33 sites with significant market saturation
- **Large Cities**: Higher development costs offset rent advantages

### **Market Opportunities**
- **Rural Sites**: 85 properties with lower costs, good rent potential
- **Suburban Sites**: 37 properties balancing costs and rents
- **4% Bond Deals**: 40 exceptional sites for non-competitive financing
