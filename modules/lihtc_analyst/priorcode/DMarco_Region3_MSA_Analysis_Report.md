**Analysis Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Analyst**: LIHTC Analysis System  
**Purpose**: Investigate potential MSA AMI inflation in D'Marco Region 3 sites

## Executive Summary

**‚úÖ GOOD NEWS**: Unlike previous Austin/Houston MSA rural corrections, most D'Marco Region 3 sites can achieve their HUD AMI rent targets. Only 1 out of 23 sites needed correction.

**üéØ KEY FINDING**: The "exceptional" 4% rankings for D'Marco Region 3 sites are **mostly justified** by market reality, not MSA inflation.

- **Austin MSA Rural**: Bastrop County (32% over-valued), Caldwell County (42% over-valued)
- **Houston MSA Rural**: Waller County (27% over-valued)  
- **Previous Dallas MSA Rural**: Kaufman County (7%), Parker County (23%), Ellis County (23%)

## Impact Analysis

### Before vs After Corrections

| Metric | Original | Corrected | Change |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Total Sites** | 23 | 23 | - |
| **Sites Corrected** | 0 | 1 | +1 |
| **4% Exceptional Sites** | 23 | 23 | No change |
| **9% Viable Sites** | 20 | 20 | No change |

### Why Most Sites Remain Exceptional

1. **Established Suburbs**: Frisco and Prosper are genuine suburban markets that easily exceed HUD AMI rents
2. **Growth Towns**: Celina and Anna are experiencing Dallas sprawl, pushing rents higher
3. **Regional Premium**: Dallas MSA commands higher rents than rural Texas markets
4. **Market Timing**: 2024-2025 rent growth has caught up to HUD projections

## Comparison to Previous MSA Corrections

| MSA | Counties Corrected | Over-Valuation Range | D'Marco Region 3 |
|-----|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Austin MSA** | Bastrop, Caldwell | 32-42% | Aubrey: 17.3% |
| **Houston MSA** | Waller | 27% | Much less severe |
| **Dallas MSA (Previous)** | Kaufman, Parker, Ellis | 7-23% | Only 1 site affected |

## Business Implications

### üí° Investment Recommendations

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (No MSA Inflation Risk)**:
- **Frisco sites**: Premium suburban market, rents 20% above HUD target
- **Prosper sites**: Growing suburb, rents 12% above HUD target  
- **Celina sites**: Transition market achieving HUD targets

**MODERATE CONFIDENCE**:
- **Anna sites**: Small town but achieving targets
- **Melissa sites**: Modest 3.5% over-valuation, manageable

**EXERCISE CAUTION**:
- **Aubrey sites**: 17.3% over-valued, very small town (4,000 population)

### üéØ Strategic Focus

1. **Prioritize Established Suburbs**: Frisco and Prosper offer the strongest rent-to-HUD ratios
2. **Growth Markets**: Celina represents rural-to-suburban transition opportunity  
3. **Small Town Risk**: Aubrey demonstrates continued small-town rural risk

## Conclusion

**The D'Marco Region 3 "exceptional" rankings are largely JUSTIFIED by market reality.** 

Unlike the Austin and Houston MSA rural inflation discovered earlier, the Dallas MSA towns in Region 3 are either:
- Established suburbs (Frisco, Prosper) that easily exceed HUD targets
- Growth markets (Celina, Anna) benefiting from Dallas sprawl
- Transition markets (Melissa) with modest and manageable over-valuation

**Only Aubrey required correction**, and this represents just 1 out of 23 sites (4.3%).

### Recommendation
Proceed with confidence on most D'Marco Region 3 sites, with enhanced due diligence on very small towns like Aubrey.
