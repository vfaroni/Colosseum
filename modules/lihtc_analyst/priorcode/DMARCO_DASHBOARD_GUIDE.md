**Welcome to Texas LIHTC Land Acquisition!**

## 🎯 Your Mission
Find and secure the best land sites for affordable housing development using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Launch the Dashboard
```bash
python3 launch_dmarco_dashboard.py
```
Or double-click `launch_dmarco_dashboard.py` in Finder.

### First Day Checklist
- [ ] Launch dashboard and explore all tabs

## 📱 Dashboard Features

### 1. Hot Leads Tab (Start Here Daily!)
This is your command center. Properties are color-coded by urgency:
- 🔥 **RED (Hot)**: Contact TODAY - broker is motivated!
- 🟠 **ORANGE (Warm)**: Follow up within 3 days
- 🔵 **BLUE (Cold)**: Check weekly

**Pro Tip**: Start each day by reviewing all hot leads before 9 AM.

### 2. Adding Notes with Quick Tags
Every interaction matters! Use notes to track:
- Broker conversations
- Site visit observations  
- Deal terms discussed
- Your gut feelings

**Essential Quick Tags**:
- `#motivated-seller` - Seller needs to close quickly
- `#price-negotiable` - Room to negotiate on price
- `#quick-close` - Can close in <30 days
- `#broker-responsive` - Broker replies quickly
- `#site-visit-done` - You've seen the property

**Example Note**:
```
Spoke with Jim (broker) - very motivated seller due to divorce. 
Willing to drop price 10% for quick close. Prefers text after 3pm.
#motivated-seller #price-negotiable #quick-close
```

### 3. Map View
Visual overview of all properties:
- **Red pins**: Hot leads (prioritize these!)
- **Orange pins**: Warm leads
- **Blue pins**: Cold leads or new properties

Click any pin to see details and add notes.

### 4. Broker Contact Management
Each property shows:
- Broker company name
- Direct phone number
- Your interaction history

**Best Practices**:
1. Text first introduction
2. Call within 24 hours
3. Log EVERY interaction
4. Note communication preferences

## 💡 LIHTC Crash Course

### What Makes a Good Site?

#### ✅ MUST HAVES:
1. **QCT or DDA Status** = 30% more tax credits!
   - QCT: Low-income census tract
   - DDA: Expensive area to develop
   
2. **No Competition Within 1 Mile** (Last 3 Years)
   - This is the "One Mile Rule"
   - If violated = DEAL KILLER!

3. **Reasonable Flood Insurance**
   - Zones VE/V/AE/A = 2.5-3x higher insurance
   - Zone X = Standard rates (good!)

#### 🎯 GREAT TO HAVE:
- Under $250k purchase price
- 2-10 acres (ideal size)
- Near amenities but not required by TDHCA
- In growing areas

### Questions to Ask Every Broker

**Opening Questions**:
1. "Why is the seller selling?" (Reveals motivation)
2. "How flexible are they on price?" 
3. "What's the fastest they could close?"

**Due Diligence Questions**:
4. "Are utilities available at the site?"
5. "What's the current zoning?"
6. "Any environmental issues I should know about?"
7. "Has anyone else made offers?"

**Closing Questions**:
8. "What other properties do you have available?"
9. "Can we schedule a site visit this week?"

## 📊 Understanding the Scores

### Land Viability Score (0-100)
- **90-100**: Excellent opportunity, pursue aggressively
- **80-89**: Good opportunity, worth exploring
- **70-79**: Has challenges but possible
- **Below 70**: Significant issues, probably skip

### What Lowers Scores:
- ❌ Other LIHTC projects nearby (competition)
- ❌ High flood insurance zones
- ❌ No QCT/DDA status (less tax credits)
