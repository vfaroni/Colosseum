Award Announcement: SEPTEMBER 9, 2025
Base Path: /Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/Bill Rice/Structured Consultants/AI Projects/CA_9p_2025_R2_Perris

CRITICAL TIMELINE (FROM 2025 CTCAC CALENDAR):
---------------------------------------------
- Application Deadline: July 8, 2025
- Committee Meeting: September 9, 2025 (Award Decision)
- Time to Prepare: ~6 months from January 2025
- Key Milestones:
  * Market Study: Must be ordered by early May (6 months fresh)
  * Local Approvals: Should be complete by June
  * All commitments: Must be dated within 180 days of application

CRITICAL SET-ASIDE INFORMATION:
-------------------------------
- Applying in AT-RISK/PRESERVATION SET-ASIDE (5% of annual allocation)
- NO PROJECTS APPLIED IN 1ST ROUND 2025 (excellent opportunity)
- Generally NOT COMPETITIVE - at-risk transactions usually receive allocation
- Not applying in Geographic set-aside
- While still scored, threshold compliance is more critical than maximizing points

CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:
-------------------------------------
1. This is an AT-RISK preservation project, which has specific scoring advantages under CTCAC regulations
2. USDA RD 515 properties have unique requirements and documentation needs
3. The property has a non-rural designation despite being USDA financed
4. Application deadline is July 8, 2025 - firm deadline
5. EXPANSION PROJECT: Adding 4 units (60 to 64) plus ADA conversions - this affects scoring and basis calculations
6. Focus should be on MEETING THRESHOLDS rather than maximizing competitive scoring

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT STEPS:
-------------------------------
1. PRIORITY FOCUS - THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS (since not competitive):
   - Verify property qualifies as "at-risk" under CTCAC definitions
   - Site control documentation
   - Zoning confirmation (verify allows 64 units)
   - Environmental reviews (Phase I)
   - Financial feasibility (including new construction)
   - Management company requirements
   - Minimum construction standards
   - Relocation plan requirements (for units being converted to ADA)

2. SCORING CONSIDERATIONS (still required but not competitive):
   - Meet minimum score requirements
   - Focus on easily documentable points
   - Don't spend excessive time maximizing points
   - Ensure all claimed points are fully supported

3. USDA COORDINATION:
   - Will need USDA approval for subordination
   - Rent restrictions overlay with tax credit rents
   - Potential for project-based rental assistance
   - Approval for adding 4 new units to existing property

4. TIMELINE MILESTONES FOR JULY 8, 2025 APPLICATION:
   - January 2025: Begin application preparation
   - February 2025: Order Phase I Environmental
   - March 2025: Finalize development team, begin local approvals
   - April 2025: Draft financial projections, begin commitment letters
   - May 2025: Order market study (must be <6 months old)
   - June 2025: Finalize all documentation, local approvals
   - Early July 2025: Final review and submission

5. AT-RISK SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
   - Must document at-risk status (expiring restrictions, etc.)
   - May need evidence from USDA on program status
   - Tenant notification requirements
   - Preservation plan documentation

6. CONSTRUCTION SCOPE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - 4 new 1BR ADA units (new construction eligible basis)
   - 3 existing 2BR conversions to ADA (rehabilitation eligible basis)
   - New community room (common area basis)
   - New office (common area basis)
   - Remaining 57 units rehabilitation scope

RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
------------------------------
1. Read QAP sections specific to At-Risk set-aside requirements
2. Document property's at-risk qualification status
3. Review the main application Excel workbook structure
4. Verify 2025 tab structure matches historical structure
5. Focus on threshold requirement documentation
6. Confirm zoning allows 64 units (density increase)
7. Begin USDA coordination for approvals
8. Create project timeline working backward from July 8, 2025

DATA ORGANIZATION TIPS:
-----------------------
- All downloaded documents maintain original CTCAC naming where possible
- Project_Notes folder contains summaries and tracking documents
- Consider creating subfolders in 9_Percent_Applications for attachments as collected
- May want to create a "Working_Documents" folder for drafts
- Tab folders should contain all supporting documents for that section
- Create "At_Risk_Documentation" folder for preservation evidence
