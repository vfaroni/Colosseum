## CHAPTER 1: AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM STATUTORY CRITERIA

The Housing Trust Fund Handbook contains the Department of Commerce (Commerce or department) Housing Division's policies that it uses to administer the affordable housing programs . RCW 43.185A is the statute that authorizes Commerce to invest in affordable housing. This chapter establishes the legal foundation and requirements for funding the affordable housing programs, collectively known since its inception in 1986 as the Housing Trust Fund (HTF). Therefore, the HTF Handbook applies to all affordable housing activities funded by the legislature and administered by the Housing Division. These statutory criteria and the policies in the HTF Handbook apply unless specifically waived or modified by the legislature, or if funds are allocated through the HOME and National Housing Trust Fund programs (separate handbooks are available online).

## Section 100. Purpose

## RCW 43.185A.020 states:

The affordable housing program is created in the department for the purpose of developing and preserving affordable housing and coordinating public and private resources targeted to meet the affordable housing needs of low-income households in the state of Washington.

- (2) At least thirty percent of these moneys used in any given funding cycle must be for the benefit of projects located in rural areas of the state as defined by the department. If the department determines that it has not received an adequate number of suitable applications for rural projects during any given funding cycle, the department may allocate unused moneys for projects in nonrural areas of the state.
- (3) The department must prioritize allocating at least, but not limited to, 10 percent of these moneys used in any given funding cycle to organizations that serve and are substantially governed by individuals disproportionately impacted by homelessness, including black, indigenous, and other people of color and, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender, and other gender-diverse individuals.

- (2) All housing trust fund loan or grant recipients, except for those receiving preservation awards under RCW 43.185A.180, must provide certified final development cost reports to the department in a form acceptable to the department. The department must use the certified final development cost reports data as part of its cost containment policy and to report to the legislature. Beginning December 1, 2023, and continuing every odd-numbered year, the department must provide the appropriate committees of the legislature with a report of its final cost data for each project funded through the housing trust fund. Such cost data must, at a minimum, include:
6. (a) Total development cost per unit for each project completed within the past two complete fiscal years; and
7. (b) Descriptive statistics such as average and median per unit costs, regional cost variation, and other costs that the department deems necessary to improve cost controls and enhance understanding of development costs.
- (3) The department must coordinate with the housing finance commission to identify relevant development costs data and ensure that the measures are consistent across relevant agencies.

## CHAPTER 2: FUNDING GUIDELINES

## Section 200. Purpose

This chapter contains the guidelines for the award and management of all affordable housing program activities that have been competitively awarded and/or directly appropriated funds by the Legislature (unless otherwise required in the appropriation proviso).

## Section 201. Program Guidelines

## 201.1. Priorities and Preferences

RCW 43.185A.140 establishes criteria, priorities and preferences for the allocation of Housing Trust Fund resources. Commerce makes every effort to balance statutory priorities and preferences and to ensure distribution of funds statewide. In compliance with RCW 43.185A.140, the HTF targets at least 30 percent of funds to projects located in rural areas of the State, and 10 percent of funds to By and For Organizations . 'Rural' and 'By and For Organizations' are defined in the Glossary included at the end of this Handbook.

In awarding funds, Commerce gives preference to projects serving households with the lowest incomes, persons with special needs, and populations with a disproportionate need for housing assistance relative to the general population.

Commerce uses the same criteria to evaluate all projects of similar type (e.g., project size, type, location, etc.). In addition to the statutory criteria contained in RCW 43.185A.150, Commerce evaluates projects based on a number of factors:

- Vulnerable populations served and housing needs
- Cost reasonableness
- Financial feasibility
- Readiness
- Applicant's experience and capacity to develop and manage the project
- Ability to provide appropriate services, if applicable
- Pro-equity and anti-racism characteristics
- Local support and funding

## 201.2. Cost Containment Policy

Commerce compares projects of similar type, activity, size and geographic location to determine cost reasonableness as follows:

Project type:

Rental, Shelter, or Homeownership

Activity:

New construction or Rehabilitation

Size:

Small (1-25 units), Medium (26-100 units), Large (&gt;100 units)

Location:

King/Pierce/Snohomish Counties; Other Metro; Non-Metro (rural)

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Project costs are 'reasonable' if the per -unit cost is at or below 110 percent of the average per unit cost of comparable projects within the same funding round. If there are insufficient projects of similar type, activity, size, and location within a funding round to provide for a reasonable comparison, data from up to three prior rounds will be used. (Average per-unit costs will not be published in advance, since they cannot be determined until applications have been received.)

Commerce may allow higher capital costs if the applicant can demonstrate that these costs would result in sufficient savings over time in operating and maintenance costs to justify the additional expense. Commerce excludes land acquisition and capitalized reserves from the cost comparison.

Note: This cost containment policy is used in the application evaluation and scoring process. When there are not enough applications in a category, scoring for cost containment may need to be omitted on those applications (details are published in the HTF solicitation for applications).

## 201.3. Funding Limits

Commerce sets competitive HTF award limits as part of its effort to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of available funds across the state, project types, and applicant organizations. Commerce reserves the right to adjust the HTF award limits, as necessary for a fair and equitable distribution of funds across the state, project types, and applicant organizations. Each published Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) will include specific funding limits, which may differ by fund sources (e.g. federal programs, the state Housing Trust Fund, and/or as directed by the legislature.

State funding is a keystone for developing projects in many areas of the state, and each year the funding available from Federal, State and Local sources changes. Applicants should seek maximum leverage from alternate sources, including making joint applications to WSHFC for Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), when applicable.

Direct appropriations made by the Legislature to specified projects are not included in the HTF award limit calculations. However, applicants should note that direct appropriations are used by the HTF application review team and included when measuring and scoring the amount of state investment in a project.

General per project limits (see NOFA for specific funding limits):

- The maximum award per multifamily/rental project is $5 Million. This includes shelter projects and scatter-site rental projects.
- The maximum award per homeownership project is $4 Million.

Per applicant limits:

- Per RCW 43.185A.150(8), the department may not establish a maximum per-applicant award.

Commerce reserves the right to make awards above the limit in the Handbook. Each NOFA will establish the specific process for submitting a waiver. Refer to Section 301.2.1. Threshold Waivers for details about requesting a waiver.

## 201.4. Grant and Loan Terms

RCW 43.185A.060 directs that the state's interest be protected upon either the sale or change of use of HTF-financed projects. Commerce will provide awards in the form of contracts for deferred loans, recoverable grants, or as specific in the competitive solicitation . The State's interest in the property will be secured by appropriate collateral and documentation, such as a Deed of Trust, Low Income Housing Covenant, and Promissory Note. The typical term of a new HTF loan or grant will match the Commitment Length (Section 203.2. Length of Commitment).

- A. Recoverable grants will be offered for emergency shelters, transitional housing, group homes (including Adult Family Homes, Oxford houses and State Operated Living Alternatives), seasonal farmworker housing and homeownership projects. This means the funds will be contracted as a grant so long as the terms of the contract are met for the duration of the commitment period. If the contract's terms are not met, Commerce may recover the granted funds. Recoverable grants will also be offered when required by a budget appropriation/proviso or by the funding source (e.g., tax-exempt bonds can only be granted). Funds are recoverable if there is a change of use, change of ownership, refinance, sale of property, or violation of contract terms.
- B. Fully deferred payment loans will be offered for all other multifamily rental housing projects for the duration of their contract terms.
1. The loans will be payable in full, including accrued 1% simple interest, at loan maturity or at the end of the contract's commitment period (40 or 50 years) .
2. Loan repayment prior to loan maturity or prior to the end of the contract's commitment period, including a shared appreciation payment, will be required in the event of a property's change in use or sale, except when sold to the original project sponsor or when transferred to another eligible entity pre-approved by Commerce, and when the original sponsor or eligible entity will commit to assume the current contract and covenants and fulfill their requirements through the end of the commitment period.
- C. Other loan terms may be offered IF/WHEN the awardee requests loans with hard loan payments. Commerce will not issue loans with soft or cash-flow loan payments.

## 201.4.1. Grant and Loan Recipients and Assignees

HTF awards will be made to eligible applicants as defined in Section 202.1. Eligible Applicants. All grants, loans, and related legal documents will be between Commerce and the eligible award recipient when State-originating funds are used (see HOME and NHTF Program Guidelines for specifics regarding awards including Federal funds).

Commerce can only contract with a single entity that is eligible under RCW 43.185A.040 and has legal control over the property. Commerce may approve assignment of a HTF loan to another HTF-eligible organization if it will preserve or enhance the project and protect the State's interest. Commerce may also approve assignment of a HTF loan to a Limited Partnership (LP) or Limited Liability Company (LLC) under the following conditions:

- For non-tax credit projects, the HTF award recipient must be the sole member and manager of the LP/LLC, and the LP/LLC must be treated as a disregarded entity by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes.

Version: March 28, 2025

## Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- For LIHTC projects where there is an investor, the HTF award recipient must demonstrate that it is the controlling managing member/general partner of the governing limited corporation and that the partnership or formation agreement contains provisions that demonstrate actual control and management over the project and sufficient ownership in the organizational partnership structure to demonstrate that the HTF award recipient has sustained meaningful control over the project and cannot be easily removed.

When the HTF award recipient is in a partnership -be that with another HTF eligible or noneligible entity - the formation agreement must also contain the following provisions:

- o If there are other members of the Corporation or Limited Partnership, the HTF award recipient/contractor must provide a partnership agreement with clauses that provide the award recipient/contractor:
- A right to exercise option to purchase at tax credit exit*;
- A right to be first in the waterfall for deferred developer fee*;
- Meaningful control over the administration of the project; and
- A right not to be removed without cause and at the sole discretion of the partnership.
- *The first two rights may be shared between the HTF Award Recipient and another Eligible Entity.
- o If at any time the investor or partner initiates a removal of the HTF contractor from the Corporation or Limited Partnership, they and the HTF contractor must:
- Provide reasonable notice to Commerce;
- Must ensure any successor managing partner or member must be an eligible entity as defined in RCW 43.185A.040; and
- Must obtain consent from Commerce.
- .
- All disbursements of HTF funds will be made to the nonprofit award recipient.
- The nonprofit recipient's obligations under the HTF contract will remain in effect.

## 201.5. Prevailing Wage

Recipients of HTF funds may be subject to, and must comply, if applicable with RCW 39.12 Prevailing Wages On Public Works (Prevailing Wages).

HTF grant applicants/recipients should assume that the Prevailing Wages will apply and build the requisite costs into all project development budgets prior to applying to the HTF, unless they obtained an otherwise determination from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I).

If the HTF applicant/recipient receives a loan that is incurring interest, is not forgivable, and is required to be repaid in full, such HTF loan in and of itself is not expected to trigger a requirement that prevailing wages be paid on the project. However, if the applicant/recipient is receiving other public funds and/or is a public entity (e.g., city, county, housing authority), it may be required to pay prevailing wages on the project. A definitive determination regarding the applicability of Prevailing Wages can only be obtained from L&amp;I.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

It is the sole responsibility of all HTF applicants/recipients to examine their project facts and all aspects of their expected funding prior to applying for HTF funding to determine whether prevailing wages must be paid on their project and, if so, what wage rates apply. Commerce further recommends that HTF applicants/recipients consult with L&amp;I and their private legal counsel regarding Prevailing Wages requirements and specific factual questions (e.g., will the project funding structure activate a prevailing wage requirement?). Failure to secure a determination from L&amp;I prior to commencement of work on a project can result in significant additional cost to the project. Commerce cannot guarantee, and applicants under no circumstances assume, that funds will be available to address gaps created as a result of a post-hoc L&amp;I determination of wage rates.

Commerce staff is not authorized and is not responsible for determining whether Prevailing Wages law applies to any specific project, or any funding type . Each project's unique financing structure (i.e., the amount and terms of all public funds awarded to or invested in the Project) may affect the applicability of Prevailing Wage law. Furthermore, Commerce cannot guarantee that funds can be provided to cover additional project costs if a higher prevailing wage rate (e.g., commercial rather than residential) is determined to be required by L&amp;I. The HTF applicant/recipient is responsible for including applicable prevailing wage requirements in construction bid specifications.

L&amp;I provided Commerce with the following helpful information: L&amp;I cannot provide a blanket statement that Prevailing Wages law does not apply to a project, since L&amp;I cannot be certain they know every aspect of all of the project's details. However, L&amp;I can and will assist you if you provide specific facts and ask if those particular facts activate a Prevailing Wages law requirement. Some trades have a residential prevailing rate. The residential construction rates are generally lower than the regular (sometimes called 'commercial') rates. WAC 296-127-010 defines 'residential construction' for the Prevailing Wages. L&amp;I can assist you on whether your project facts conform to this definition. L&amp;I also provides a helpful policy on how L&amp;I applies that 'residential construction' rule. For more information regarding prevailing wages, please consult L&amp;I's website or contact L&amp;I at PW1@lni.wa.gov or (360) 902-5335.

Note: Projects receiving HOME, National Housing Trust Fund funds, or HUD vouchers may also be subject to the wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act. Refer to the HOME-NHTF Program Guidelines and to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for details.

## 201.6. Use of the Apprenticeship Program

For projects with construction costs of at least $1 million, regardless of the source used to pay the constructions costs (i.e. whether HTF, the other public funders, or private funds), the HTF contractor must include apprentice training program requirements in their construction contractor bid package. The HTF contractor must also make best efforts to select a prime contractor that will hire apprentices enrolled in an approved apprenticeship program and who will procure sub-contractors who will also hire apprentices enrolled in an approved apprenticeship program as described in RCW 39.04.300 through RCW 39.04.320. At least 15 percent of the labor hours must be performed by apprentices enrolled through the Washington State Apprenticeship and Training Council (WSATC).

The HTF contractor is required to acquire a completed 'Statement of Apprenticeship/Journeyman Participation' form from the general contractor that includes subcontractor data. The HTF contractor must submit this form to the Washington Community Reinvestment Association (WCRA) and the HTF Project Manager with each voucher request.

For more information regarding apprenticeship programs, please consult the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries Apprenticeship Programs website.

## 201.7. Archaeological and Cultural Resources

Nearly all capital projects are subject to the requirements of Washington State Executive Order (EO 2102). State funded projects must consult with Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) and affected tribes on the potential effects of projects on cultural resources proposed in statefunded projects including acquisition, new construction, and rehabilitation that will not undergo Section 106 review under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, including grant or pass-through funding that culminates in construction or land acquisitions, to determine potential effects to cultural resources.

Generally, state and federal funded projects are required to submit an Inadvertent Discovery Plan (IDP) in the event that historical or cultural artifacts are discovered at the project site during construction or rehabilitation. The HTF contractor shall immediately stop construction and notify the local historic preservation officer and the state historic preservation officer at DAHP at (360) 586-3065 and all parties listed on the contractor's Inadvertent Discovery Plan.

DAHP's EZ Project forms are used to satisfy state and federal requirements for project compliance reviews. Commerce project managers are responsible for completing the EO 21-02 process in collaboration with contractor's and project developers. The HTF Project Manager will utilize the EZ Project forms found on DAHP's we bsite at https://dahp.wa.gov/:

- EZ Project Form EO 21-02 (State funded projects)
- EZ Project Form Section 106 (Federal funded projects)

Projects are required to demonstrate compliance with historical, cultural, and tribal review processes, including any recommended survey work, prior to the disbursement of HTF funds for any site work or construction or rehabilitation activity. If HTF funds will be used for land acquisition, the review process must be completed prior to the second draw. Compliance will be evidenced by the following:

- Letter of determination from DAHP.
- Copy of dated notification from the HTF contractor to all of the affected tribes and tribes' response, if any is received. Tribes are required to respond within 30 days of notification. If no response is received within 30 days of notification, there is considered to be no impact.
- Documentation that any applicable requirements (by DAHP or a tribe) have been satisfied or that an approved plan is in place.
- An IDP (Inadvertent Discovery Plan) is required prior to contract execution when grounddisturbing activities occur. See IDP information at https://dahp.wa.gov/archaeology/humanremains/recommended-inadvertent-human-remains-discovery-language.

If the review process identifies a need for Commerce to meet with affected tribes, the HTF Project M anager is responsible for notifying the contractor and Commerce's tribal liaison representative and coordinate all meetings and documentation.

## 201.8. Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard

All affordable housing projects or programs receiving state capital funds from the Housing Trust Fund are subject to RCW 39.35D.080 and must be built or implemented according to the Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard (ESDS). Please refer to Section 207. Evergreen Sustainable

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Development Standard for detailed information pertaining to the ESDS. Note that this applies to all funds managed by Commerce, and therefore includes projects funded by federal sources (HOME, NHTF).

Note: The Standard is reevaluated and updated periodically to reflect changes in the green building industry and other laws, such as the State Building Code. HTF contractors are responsible to follow the version of ESDS currently in effect. If unsure, contact the Evergreen Program manager for clarification.

## Section 202. Eligibility Guidelines

## 202.1. Eligible Applicants

The following types of organizations are eligible to received HTF funds as referenced in RCW 43.185A.040.

- Local governments
- Local housing authorities
- Nonprofit community or neighborhood-based organizations
- Federally recognized Indian tribes in Washington State
- Regional support networks established under Chapter 71.24 RCW
- Regional or statewide nonprofit housing assistance organizations

Although an organization may be eligible to receive HTF funds, the proposed project or activity must also be eligible (see Section 202.2. Eligible/Ineligible Project Types and Section 202.3. Eligible Activities).

Nonprofit applicants must provide a certification from the Washington State Secretary of State that they are registered with the Washington Secretary of State's office, and are currently listed to do business in Washington as a nonprofit organization in accordance with RCW 24.03A. Furthermore, nonprofit organizations must submit a letter from the Internal Revenue Service designating them as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, and a copy of their by-laws stating a clear housing purpose. Commerce views organizations that share common by-laws, board members (more than 50 percent), and service area as the same organization within their common service area.

## 202.2. Eligible/Ineligible Project Types

HTF funds can only be used for affordable housing for low-income people. The following list of project types serve as a guideline for prospective HTF applicants and funding recipients to understand what is eligible or ineligible for HTF Capital Funding. Refer to the Glossary for definitions.

HTF funds may be used in mixed use and/or mixed income developments specifically for those components of the project necessary for the development of the housing, i.e. foundation and other structural aspects of the building required for the housing itself. If a project includes other components, such as commercial spaces, nonprofit facilities, or market-rate housing (for higher income people), those components cannot be funded with HTF funds. Increasingly, more projects are needed to provide medical or mental health services that include housing or residential stays. In general, these are identified as facilities and are not eligible for HTF funds.

When Ineligible project types are funded by the legislature and administered by the Housing Division, Commerce will enact guidelines that are as consistent as possible with the standards in the HTF Handbook. The following project types are designated as eligible or ineligible for HTF funding:

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Eligible Project Type (in alphabetic order):

- Assisted living facilities as defined under RCW 18.20.020(2) -limited to those with private apartments and lease

Notes: For HOME and NHTF eligible activities, please review the HOME and NHTF program materials located on the program webpages. Off-site improvements may be eligible under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Housing Enhancement Grant program. For more information, refer to the Housing Enhancement Grants section of the CDBG Specialty Grants webpage.

## 202.4. Eligible Populations

State HTF-funded housing units may serve households with incomes less than 80 percent of the local area median income as stated in RCW 43.185A.005.

Legislative provisos may require that certain population groups be given priority for housing. Information regarding specific priorities will be included in the NOFA for each funding round.

## 202.4.1. Farmworker Housing

HTF funds can be used for both year-round and seasonal farmworker housing. Specific requirements and limitations apply to seasonal projects.

For purposes of HTF funding, the relevant definitions are included in the Glossary.

All HTF-funded seasonal farmworker housing projects must obtain a Temporary Worker Housing and Migrant Farmworker Housing license from the Washington State Department of Health and must comply with all applicable state and federal regulations pertaining to the construction, licensing, and operation of temporary worker housing. The project's Management Plan must identify the an ticipated annual operating period (e.g., May 1 through October 31).

Seasonal housing projects may lease up to 75 percent of available beds to agricultural employers, provided:

- The project's Management Plan defines a process for leasing beds that allows for participation by multiple employers.
- The cost per bed-night charged to an agricultural employer is no less than the average annual cost per bed-night for the project.
- Agricultural employers sign a lease agreement that identifies the number of beds rented, period of occupancy, amount of rent, and procedures for dealing with unused beds.
- Rents collected by agricultural employers do not exceed amounts charged to farmworkers on a walk-in basis.

## Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Agricultural employers leasing beds for farmworkers admitted to the U.S. for agricultural labor under Section 201(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act comply with all elements of that program, to include paying 100 percent of housing costs for those workers.

## 202.5. Eligible/Ineligible Costs

HTF program funds may be used only for low-income housing units and other space integral to the lowincome residential development, such as parking and common areas that are for the exclusive use of low-income tenants in the project (e.g. community kitchen, computer room, case manager's office, and other common areas such as lobby, corridors, stairwells, and storage areas). Costs associated with market rate units or commercial areas are not eligible for reimbursement and should be segregated from low-income residential costs.

## Eligible costs include:

- Accounting/Audit expenses during development period, to include 3 rd party cost certification
- Appraisal

- Office equipment
- Operating reserves and operating subsidies
- Soft cost contingencies

## 202.5.1. Eligibility of Prior Costs

HTF funds may be used to reimburse costs incurred up to two years prior to the date of the HTF award, or three years prior to the date of contract execution, whichever is earlier. Requests to use HTF funds to reimburse earlier expenditures must be submitted and approved in advance of contract execution. HOME and NHTF funds are subject to HUD specific disbursal requirements. Contact your HTF Project Manager for details on eligibility of prior costs for federal funds.

Note: Refer to Section 403.4 for information concerning Voucher Request Processing and Section 402.4.4 for Electronic Funds Transfer setup.

## Section 203. Project Guidelines

## 203.1. Affordability

Rent payments, including tenant-paid utilities, may not exceed 30 percent of the maximum monthly income level established for each assisted housing unit. Maximum rents are based on the income of the target population rather than the individual household income and are derived from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Section 8 income limits.

## 203.2. Length of Commitment

Multifamily Only (see Chapter 6 for commitment periods for homeownership projects)

To ensure the long-term affordability of HTF-funded housing units and remain in compliance with RCW 43.185A.150(6)(b), applicants must commit to serving the project's target population for 40 years , or 50 years in King County. Additional years of affordability may be required based on special funding provisos.

The length of commitment will be secured by a covenant running with the land.

Any change during the length of commitment to the population served or to supportive services provided for residents with special needs requires prior approval by Commerce.

## 203.3. Tenant Relocation

Relocation assistance must be provided to tenants who are permanently or temporarily displaced. This tenant may be a residential tenant or one that conducts a small business, a farm operation, or a business as defined in RCW 8.26. Relocation costs are an eligible use of HTF funds for residential tenants. All projects requiring tenant relocation must submit a description of the relocation plan, the costs involved, and the funding source(s) to be used.

HTF funded projects must follow the relocation requirements of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) as described in RCW 8.26.

Note: Projects receiving NHTF or HOME funds must follow the federal requirements for these programs as identified in the program specific handbooks located on the HTF webpage.

WSDOT and Uniform Relocation Act (URA) require notices be sent to tenants regarding the type of displacement and benefits provided to tenants. Applicants must submit samples of the notices they are using.

## 203.4. Project Location and Consistency with Local Plans

Projects receiving HTF funds must be consistent with applicable local comprehensive growth management plans and must meet all zoning and building code requirements of the local jurisdiction. Applicants should also show how the proposed project meets identified housing needs in the housing element of a local comprehensive plan, if in a fully planning county, or housing action plan. Projects should consult with the local government to take advantage of any incentives for affordable housing such as density bonuses, tax exemptions, fee waivers, or expedited review.

Projects should consult with the local government to take advantage of any incentives for affordable housing such as density bonuses, tax exemptions, fee waivers, or expedited review.

The project must also be consistent with local HUD Consolidated Plans. If a local Consolidated Plan does not exist, the State's Consolidated Plan should be understood to apply, and compliance must be established if HUD funds (HOME, NHTF) are being pursued.

Projects for homeless families or individuals must be consistent with a local or state Continuum of Care plan and the county's 5 -Year Homeless Housing Plan (RCW 43.185C.050).

Projects accessible to services, jobs, transportation and amenities are strongly encouraged and will be given preference in accordance with RCW 43.185A.150(6)(k) and (m).

## 203.5. Project Schedule

An application must include a project schedule that provides, at a minimum, a list of realistic milestones that give a comprehensive picture of tasks, completion dates and staff responsibilities. The 'Project Schedule' form contained in the application provides a place to en ter specific benchmark dates in the areas of site control, feasibility analysis/due diligence, relocation, financing, design/permitting, construction, and occupancy. Applicants should include processes already underway, and any additional tasks or benchmarks appropriate to their project. The project schedule must include target dates for the start of construction and certificate of occupancy or substantial completion (i.e., placed in service).

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Projects are generally expected to finalize due diligence and documented funding commitments within 12 months of receipt of a project-specific award letter and execute documents within 15 months from award date. Projects are expected to be placed in service within two years of contract execution. The application announcement and award letter may identify a specific date by which the start of construction is expected to begin. If specific timelines are established and not met, an application or award may be withdrawn and may affect an organization's competitiveness in subsequent funding rounds. Alternatively, a voluntary rescission of an award does not negatively affect an applicant's future competitiveness. Timeline extensions must be requested in advance and are subject to Commerce approval. Requests must include an explanation for the delay and an updated project schedule.

## Section 204. Project Financial Guidelines

If any of the following guidelines are not followed and reflected in an applicant's HTF application for funds, the applicant must clearly explain the reasons or circumstances that make these guidelines not applicable (i.e. simply stating 'N/A' is not sufficient) .

## 204.1. Construction Lending

If an applicant proposes using HTF funds for construction or rehabilitation and these activities require a building permit, Commerce will be considered a construction lender and will contract with a third party to manage the review of project construction , at Commerce's expense. The third-party reviewer will contact award recipients directly with a list of outstanding items to be provided. Delays in providing these materials to the reviewer will delay disbursement.

## 204.2. Construction Contingency

In the development budget, applicants should assume a construction contingency of 10 percent for new construction and 15 percent for rehabilitation. If a different contingency level is used, applicants must justify the level in their application, even if HTF funds are not used for the construction contingency line item.

The third-party construction reviewer will monitor the use of contingency funds when reviewing construction draws. If the costs are determined to be unjustified, Commerce may deny reimbursement of those costs from HTF funds. If contractors are uncertain regarding the correct use of contingency funds, they should consult with their HTF Project Manager prior to expending these funds. Use of leftover construction contingency for unplanned purposes (e.g., added amenities, additional replacement reserves, etc.) must be approved in advance by Commerce.

## 204.3. Contractor's Profit and Overhead

If the general contractor is a principal, related party or otherwise has an identity of interest with the applicant or project owner, the contractor's combined profit and overhead is limited to 10 percent of total rehabilitation/construction costs plus site work costs.

## 204.4. Operating Expenses

Commerce does not have a published allowable cost range or cost per unit range. All applications must include an operating budget prepared by the proposed management entity with detailed justification supporting the proposal. In the case of homeownership projects, an affordability analysis will satisfy this provision. Commerce refers to the HUD definitions for operating expenses.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Commerce may allow projects to use cash flow to pay for services needed by project residents. HTF staff will require detailed information on the type and amount of services in the application.

If using state Operating and Maintenance (O&amp;M) or Permanent Supportive Housing Operating, Maintenance &amp; Services (PSH-OMS) Program funds, projects cannot use rental income to pay for services to tenants. Service-related costs must be paid for with service income.

If the applicant is paying for services required by a target population, the operating pro forma must include the cost of those services. If services are provided by another organization as in-kind services, the operating pro forma should exclude the cost. The form that details service revenues and expenditures should include only direct services.

Operating costs are subject to review every year as part of the annual report. Projects receiving O&amp;M or PSH-O&amp;M funds will be reviewed annually to determine the need for continued subsidy. Collectively, these will be referred to as 'OMS.' Refer to the OMS program webpage for OMS Fund annual review details.

## 204.5. Vacancy Rates

Applicants should use a 7 percent residential vacancy rate (5 percent for elderly developments) and a 10 percent non-residential vacancy rate when preparing their operating pro forma. Exceptions will be allowed if adequate justification is provided, such as in the case of very small or special needs projects.

## 204.6. Reserves

## 204.6.1. Operating Reserves

Operating reserves are intended to provide operating funds for a project during periods when occupancy rates are lower than expected and operating income is not sufficient to pay the fixed operating costs, such as utility payments, debt service, and salaries.

All projects must demonstrate in the operating pro forma the ability to capitalize an operating reserve by the end of the second full year of project operation. The operating reserve should be equivalent to at least three months of the project's first year operating expenses (Commerce supports a higher operating reserve of six month) up to six months. An exception may be allowed for special needs projects.

Operating reserves should continue to be funded for the life of the project. Over time, as actual operating expenses increase, the operating reserves should also increase. Applicants may choose to maintain a higher level of reserves, but not lower.

Note: HTF capital construction funds cannot be used to capitalize operating reserves.

## 204.6.2. Replacement Reserves

Replacement reserves are intended to accumulate and provide funds when needed to replace or maintain major systems of the building. The replacement reserves funded from capital or operating income over time should be enough to pay for the major maintenance and replacement needs of that project for the next 20 years. In general, reserve deposits should be at least $350 per unit per year inflated at 3% annually. The per unit reserves must be reflected in the development budget if they are capitalized or the operating pro forma if they are to be deposited from operating income.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Minimum replacement reserves for rehabilitation projects shall be determined by the required capital needs assessment and life cycle cost analysis (see Section 205.11. Capital Needs Assessment). The estimated useful life estimates of a life cycle cost analysis must come from a nationally recognized organization such as Marshall and Swift.

Applicants must assess their projects and establish replacement reserves with a vision of maintaining the long-term viability of the property. The assumptions behind amounts put into the budgets should be stated as part of the narrative explanation for that line item.

Operating and Replacement Reserves must remain with the Project upon Transfer or Sale where there is an assumption of the underlying HTF commitment and continued affordability. Refer to Section 504. Contract Amendments During Commitment Period.

## 204.7. Developer Fees

The following policy applies to the HTF-funded portion of the developer and project management fees:

- Commerce limits the portion of the HTF award that can be used for developer and project management fees. While Commerce does not restrict the total developer and project management fees for a project, it is expected that the fees be in line with industry standards.
- No more than 10 percent of the HTF award may be used for developer and project management fees, combined (including ESDS coordination).
- o Project management is defined as staff time, including that of a subcontractor, and project-related costs during the development/implementation period. Staff time and project-related costs claimed must be clearly documented and differentiated from other duties not related to the project.
- Payment of the developer and project management fees from HTF funds must be proportional to the level of construction completed, as determined by the third-party construction reviewer. The HTF Project Manager may allow exceptions. However, Commerce will retain no less than 10 percent of the developer and project management fees payable from HTF funds until the contractor has completed the project and complied with all submittal and contractual requirements.

## 204.8. Debt Coverage Ratio

Projects must have an overall Debt Coverage Ratio (DCR) that provides a cushion against risk that may result from unforeseen circumstances, such as higher than anticipated vacancy rates.

Deferred loans are not considered in the DCR calculation during the deferral period, only the years when they are due and payable. The annual contributions to operating and replacement reserves must be included in the operating expenses when calculating the DCR.

Projects should have an overall DCR of at least 1.15.

Commerce reserves the right, during contract development, to direct the use of excess cash flow when a project has an overall DCR greater than 1.25.

## 204.9. Subordination

Commerce requires at least two weeks to review and approve the priority and subordination agreement documents.

## a. Financial Liens, Deeds of Trust

Provided that Commerce reviews and approves the Priority and Subordination Agreement prior to signing it, Commerce may subordinate its financial lien position (deed of trust) to private lenders or community development financial institutions regardless of their investment amount. Commerce may also subordinate its financial lien position to other public funders (city, county, state, federal) which have made larger investments than Commerce in the project.

## b. Low-Income Housing Covenant

Provided that Commerce reviews and approves the Priority and Subordination Agreement prior to signing it, Commerce may allow covenants and regulatory agreements from other public funders with larger funding amounts in the project to be recorded in priority order above Commerce, provided that there is a priority and subordination agreement with the following or substantially similar language:

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, the Department of Commerce, a County, and a City, as applicable and collectively known as the 'Public Funders,' may take action to seek equitable remedies, including injunctive relief or actions to compel specific performance, to enforce their respective Contracts, Loan Documents, and covenants to the extent such actions do not result in termination or modification of another party's covenant or re gulatory agreement. The Public Funders shall each give reasonable notice to the other Public Funders of pending actions under their respective Loan Documents, covenant or regulatory agreement.

Regardless of priority among the covenants or regulatory agreements, Grantor, its successors and any other Parties obligated thereunder, shall be obligated to comply with the provisions of each covenant or regulatory agreement. The Parties acknowledge that the covenants and regulatory agreements apply simultaneously and that the Grantor(s) thereunder are obligated to comply with each of the covenants and regulatory agreements regardless of their relative priority or order of recording.

The covenants and regulatory agreements shall survive any foreclosure sale, trustee's sale, or deed in lieu thereof under any of the Deeds of Trust and shall be binding on any person or entity acquiring the Property by any means, or a successor to one who acquires the Property by any means, for as long as such person or entity retains an interest in the Property that is subject to the terms of each of the covenants or regulatory agreements.

When applicable, Commerce may allow federally required regulatory agreements, including those required by HUD.

## 204.10. Funding Commitments/Leverage

The applicant should demonstrate support for the project from local organizations and local government. A strong indicator of local support is commitment of funds for capital development. Other examples are waivers of fees for utility hook-ups or building permits, as well as waiver of impact fees.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Operations and maintenance support in the form of project-based Section 8, local OMS commitments or other local subsidies are considered as well.

Applicants must document funding commitments and leverage in the HTF application. Commerce also requires letters of commitment for donations, including sponsor contributions.

Applicants must submit a capital campaign plan if applicable.

Applicants must disclose where they have sought funding and why they have or have not secured those funds.

Commerce may award funds even though funds from other sources have not been committed. However, Commerce will not release funds until all funding commitments are confirmed.

All funds must be secured and the HTF contract executed within the timeframe identified in the HTF award letter. Otherwise, the award may be rescinded.

For mixeduse projects, a project's full funding is defined as the entire project being fully funded, including funding for any commercial space, less tenant improvements.

## 204.11. Hold Back of Funds

Five percent (5%) of the HTF administered funds will be held back until the project has been completed, including receipt by Commerce of materials related to the Placed in Service Process.

For projects using HTF funds solely for pre-construction costs, Commerce will withhold 10 percent of its award until project completion. Completion will be defined in the list of deliverables in the contract. Exceptions must be requested and approved in advance of contract execution.

## Section 205. Project Documentation Guidelines

## 205.1. Development Consultant Agreement

Applicants must provide a copy of the developer agreement if a third-party developer is used. The Agreement must clearly identify the duties, period of performance (e.g., pre-development work only, through construction completion, etc.), and developer compensation. Commerce must be notified if there is a change in developer or the role of the developer, or if the development agreement is terminated.

## 205.2. Market Study

Applicants must, at a minimum, describe efforts to identify existing rental properties within the proposed project's market area, which are available to the target population. A third -party market study must accompany the application if the project involves Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) or if another funder or source of funding requires a market study.

Market studies are not required for:

- Projects whose financing does not include 4 percent (bond) or 9 percent (competitive) LIHTCs.
- Projects whose financing does not include another public funder which requires a market study.
- Projects for persons with developmental disabilities (DD).

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Projects for persons with chronic mental illness (CMI).
- Projects for homeless persons.
- Domestic violence (DV) projects.
- Special needs projects for persons with chronic substance abuse issues combined with homelessness and/or other conditions requiring intensive support services.
- Group foster care projects.
- Tribal projects on tribal land.
- Rent-subsidized multifamily/rental projects (project-based).
- Seasonal occupancy farmworker projects.
- Homeownership projects.

If the project does not meet any of the above criteria, a market study is required. The market study must:

- Be prepared by a professional independent analyst who is on the Washington State Housing Finance Commission's Approved Analyst list.
- Be dated no more than 12 months prior to the application deadline. Updates to existing market studies will be accepted. (This guideline may be waived on a case-by-case basis.)
- Provide a detailed project description including site amenities, unit mix, comparison to market rate projects, comparison to other rent restricted projects, and a precise delineation of the market area.
- Describe the supply and demand for market rate and rent restricted housing. The analysis should include data regarding under-served or specialized low-income markets and vacancy rates for the target population of the proposed project. The study should reach a conclusion about the proposed project's competitive position.
- Include a rent gap analysis for both market rate and rent restricted housing. The study must draw conclusions, supported by data, on both the current and projected market need, the size of the pool of qualified potential residents, the demographic profile of the typical income eligible resident, absorption rate, and the viability of the proposed project as sited.
- Be submitted with the application if an applicant has site control. If site control has not been obtained at the time of application, the applicant must submit the market study upon receipt of site control.

## 205.3. Site Control

Site control is required at the time of application for all rental projects and homeownership developments. A change in site after application or award requires approval and could result in withdrawal of the application or award.

The application must include a detailed description of the site and site control documentation. Site control should be documented via:

- a deed of trust,
- current option,
- current purchase and sale agreement,
- a current title report showing the entity holding fee simple title,
- an executed lease agreement for the length of the commitment to serve low-income households, or
- an executed disposition or development agreement.

## 205.3.1 Site Control Exemption for Scattered Sites

Projects involving scattered sites (see Glossary), the locations of which has not been determined at the time of application, do not have to establish site control at the time of application. This type of project most often involves the purchase and limited rehab of single-family properties, and may include group homes, adult family homes, or similar. Applicants with projects of these types can identify the site(s) as 'to be determined' (TBD) in their applications and provide evidence of site control when the site has been determined. Once a property is identified the applicant or award recipient must obtain the Commerce's approval to include the identified site in the project.

HTF awards for rental projects involving single-family properties (e.g., group homes) are contingent upon Commerce's approval of each proposed site. The applicant must identify the pool of available single-family properties. Applicable documentation may include lists of properties in the proposed size, location, condition and price range and other comparable information. Prior to disbursing funds for any particular site, Commerce retains the right to confirm the development and operating budgets and any other pertinent information for each site.

## 205.4. Environmental Review

## 205.4.1. Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

Commerce requires multifamily/rental projects and homeownership developments to submit a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) with the application. The ESA must ensure that any environmental hazards are recognized and mitigated. If any hazards are identified, they must be abated or mitigated prior to occupancy.

## A Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment must:

- Accompany multifamily/rental, homeownership, or mobile home park applications.
- Include limited surveys of lead-based paint, asbestos, mold, and wetlands as applicable.
- Be carried out according to the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) E1527 standard.
- Include the additional scope element of evaluating previous uses of the site and other evidence of contamination on or near the site, to assure that occupants of proposed sites are not adversely affected by the hazards [per 24 CFR Part 58.5(i)(2)]
- Be dated no more than 12 months prior to the HTF application due date. (Note: A letter updating a Phase 1 assessment completed more than 12 months prior to the application due date is acceptable.)

If the Phase 1 ESA identifies any environmental hazards and recommends a Phase 2 ESA, then the latter is required and must be included in the application when available.

Commerce requires rental projects involving single-family properties (e.g., group homes) to complete a limited survey of lead-based paint, asbestos and mold hazards. Commerce reserves the right to deny funding to a project based on risk, cost, or feasibility of mitigation.

## 205.4.2. Environmental Review Requirements for Federal Funds

Projects receiving federal funds from Commerce (e.g., HOME funds) must meet both federal environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and state requirements under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). Federal environmental review requirements must be met prior to contract execution.

## 205.5. Asbestos, Lead-Based Paint, Mold, and Wetlands

The American Society for Testing Materials E1527 standard does not require assessments for asbestos, lead-based paint, mold, or wetlands. However, these concerns must be addressed as part of the due diligence requirements in HTF applications.

- For all existing buildings, limited surveys for asbestos, lead-based paint, and mold are required. At a minimum, the surveys should include documentation of a site inspection, the stated sampling methods that were applied, and a conclusion regarding the presence of these concerns. Applicants should specify these surveys as required additions when ordering the Phase 1 ESA.
- o Buildings verified to have been constructed post 1978 need not be investigated for LBP contamination.
- For all vacant land, a limited wetland survey is required. At a minimum, the survey should include documentation of a site visit, a survey of data regarding the documented presence of wetlands in the geographic area of the project site, the stated analytical method that was applied, and a conclusion regarding the presence of a wetland.

If the presence of asbestos, lead-based paint, mold, or wetland is confirmed or the probability of their presence is high, then the HTF application must contain a plan to mitigate, abate, or manage each issue. This plan must include the cost to resolve each area of concern; the development budget must reflect these costs in the space specifically provided, and not rolled into other development costs (i.e., on the Environmental Abatement line).

## 205.6. Methamphetamine Contamination

A contractor certified by the state Department of Health should conduct methamphetamine and/or fentanyl testing when methamphetamine is suspected as outlined in chapter 64.44 RCW and chapter 246-205 WAC.. A list of certified contractors is provided at https://doh.wa.gov/community-andenvironment/contaminants/drug-labs/cleanup-companies.

If contamination is detected above the legal limit, a plan for occupied units must be submitted along with remediation plan. If methamphetamine contamination is detected, but is below the limit requiring remediation, Commerce strongly encourages owners to clean affected units based on the recommendations of the testing contractor.

## 205.7. Management Plan

A Management Plan is necessary to help ensure the responsible operation of the project for the length of the commitment. The application must include a description of the proposed Management Plan. See Section 403.6.1. Requirements of the Management Plan for required content.

For acquisition projects, the Management Plan must be submitted during the contracting process. For new construction projects and rehab projects, the management plan must be submitted within 90 days of the Certificate of Occupancy date. See Section 403.6.2. Submission of the Management Plan for information regarding the submission of management plans.

Note:  Homeownership projects do not require a Management Plan.

## 205.8. Special Needs Documentation

Projects that require special licensing must provide documentation of current license. Projects applying for an initial license must provide a letter of support from the licensing agency. Letters and licensing documentation relating to this section must be submitted with the application. Applicants must provide documentation of all service funding commitments.

If an agency or organization other than the applicant provides primary support services for special needs populations, then Commerce requires submission of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that defines the roles and responsibilities of each entity. The MOU must also explain how costs will be covered.

## Projects designed to serve:

- Persons with developmental disabilities must have a letter from the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) Regional Office approving the proposed project. A referral agreement with the DSHS must be executed and submitted prior to execution of the HTF contract. The referral agreement is necessary to ensure each resident meets the eligibility requirements of DSHS's Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) program.
- Homeless persons and families must have a letter from the lead person of the local Continuum of Care Planning Group (CCPG) confirming that the project is consistent with the Continuum of Care Plan.

## 205.9. Appraisal

Commerce requires acquisition cost of real property and/or buildings to be supported by an independent appraisal of the property. State funds may not be used to reimburse acquisition costs that exceed the lesser of the appraised value of a property, the purchase price negotiated with an armslength seller, or the cost basis of an identity of interest seller.

An appraisal is required even if HTF funds are not being used for acquisition of the property. If the property is offered at a below market price, donated, acquired without purchase, or if the property is already owned by the applicant, Commerce will accept a current property tax assessment in lieu of a formal appraisal.

## An appraisal must be:

- Based on the highest and best use.
- Conducted by someone with a current general appraisal certificate in the State of Washington.
- Dated no more than 12 months prior to the application due date. (Note: A letter updating an appraisal completed more than 12 months prior to the application due date is acceptable.)

When a project's sources include USDA -RD or other HUD funding, the USDA-RD or HUD appraisal methodology will apply.

For projects that are exempt from site control at the time of application (see Section 205.3.1. Site Control Exemption for Scattered Sites), appraisals will be required before release of funds.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Scattered site multifamily/rental (e.g., group homes) or homeownership projects and down payment assistance programs are exempt from the appraisal requirement at application but must provide appraisals at the time of purchase.

## 205.10. Construction Cost Estimate

Commerce requires projects involving rehabilitation or new construction to submit a construction cost estimate with the application. If site control has not been obtained at the time of application, the cost estimate must be submitted upon receipt of site control. To ensure that project costs reflect the current market and match the construction plans, Commerce strongly advises applicants to engage a professional cost estimator or have the project architect use a professional cost estimator.

## Construction Cost Estimates must:

- Justify rehabilitation and new construction costs.
- Be prepared by a professional independent third party. Acceptable parties include the project architect, engineers, or professional cost estimators.
- Be submitted on the professional cost estimator's letterhead.
- Be based upon the capital needs assessment for rehabilitation projects and include unit-by-unit details of estimated costs.
- Include detail sufficient to indicate the life cycle of the building systems for new construction projects. A summary estimate is not enough.
- Reflect design features that are described in the application. This includes all costs associated with design features elected in the Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard (ESDS).
- Include an escalation factor that reflects construction cost increases from preparation of the cost estimate through the signing of the construction contract.
- Include an inflation adjustment, or some statement assuring the relative accuracy of costs linked directly to the planned construction start date.
- State whether or not prevailing wages were used in completing the estimate and, if so, whether residential or commercial wage rates were assumed.
- Correspond with the line items submitted in the development budget. Any differences must be documented and explained.
- Be dated no more than 12 months prior to the HTF application due date.

## 205.11. Capital Needs Assessment (CNA)

A capital needs assessment is required for all projects, except homeownership and owner-occupied rehabilitation projects. Projects that do not require building permits are not exempt from obtaining a capital needs assessment. A professional, independent third party must complete the CNA.

Submission timelines:

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Moderate Rehab projects must submit a CNA with the HTF application. The pre-construction CNA should be dated no more than 6 months prior to the application submittal date. An as-built update to the CNA must be provided within 90 days of receipt of the Certificate of Occupancy.
- New Construction and Substantial ('Gut') Rehab projects must provide an as-built CNA within six (6) months of receipt of the Certificate of Occupancy. Substantial rehab includes the replacement or improvement of all the major systems of the building, including its envelope.

The CNA must include a life cycle analysis of all building systems, an estimate of any capital contribution to replacement reserves if needed, and an estimate of the annual replacement reserve contribution. (The estimated useful life estimates of a life cycle cost analysis must come from a nationally recognized organization such as Marshall and Swift.)

For Moderate Rehab projects, the CNA should also:

- Include an inspection of all units. If 100 percent of the units are not inspected, then an explanation is required. At a minimum, this explanation should include any assumptions made concerning areas that were not inspected and the reasons for those assumptions.
- Provide the scope of work on which the construction cost estimate is based. If the construction cost estimate and its scope of work differ from the capital needs assessment, the applicant must provide an explanation.

## 205.12. Zoning and Consistency with Local Plans

Applicants must include a letter from the local jurisdiction identifying the zoning classification of the project site as part of the HTF application. Applications are required to show documentation that the site will be properly zoned and that the proposed project has received all necessary local planning approval(s) by the time of contract execution.

In order to demonstrate readiness to proceed in their application, the applicant will be required to document the current zoning and that the project is an allowable use. If it is not allowed under the current zoning, the applicant will be required to address the following:

- whether an amendment to the comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance is required;
- whether an amendment to the zoning code is required;
- whether annexation is required;
- whether division of land is required; and
- whether a variance, special or conditional use permit, or shoreline/critical area permits are required.

If any of the above are required, the application must include a timeline for obtaining these approvals and explain the likelihood of obtaining approval prior to the execution of the HTF contract. A letter from the local jurisdiction's planning/zoning officer that outlines the necessary zoning changes, as well as a timeline and projection for securing the changes, must be included in the application for funding.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

For projects located in HUD Participating Jurisdictions (PJs), applicants must provide a signed letter of consistency with the local Consolidated Plan. For a list of all Washington State PJs, please visit the HUD Exchange website.

## 205.13. Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Documents

The application includes the basic information required by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) for Tax Credit applications. This includes the LIHTC budget (Form 6C) and credit factor calculations (Form 6D). Applicants not pursuing LIHTCs are not required to complete these forms for the HTF application.

LIHTC projects are required to submit the partnership formation documents (e.g. Limited Partnership Agreement) and a copy of the Certification Regarding Financial Solvency and LIHTC History Status prior to executing contracts for HTF funds.

For 9% projects a copy of an executed Reservation Allocation Contract (RAC) is required to complete the Placed in Service process.

## Section 206. Applicant Documentation Guidelines

## 206.1. Organizational Capacity

## 206.1.1. Good Standing

An applicant must be in good standing with Commerce for a new project to be considered. Good standing is defined as:

- No outstanding findings with the HTF, or the applicant is making a good faith effort to comply with an agreed-upon corrective action plan.
- All required documents have been received and are current (i.e., insurance, audits, annual reports, etc.).
- All HTF loan repayments are current or a workout plan has been agreed to by Commerce.

Applicants that DO NOT have a history with Commerce must include documentation of 'good standing' from local public funders (city, county).

## 206.1.2. Financial Capacity and Accountability

Applicants must demonstrate, with a reasonable level of assurance, that the sponsoring organization is fiscally sound and has reliable systems to manage and account for public funds. Applicants are required to submit the following documents at Commerce's r equest:

- Audit reports for each of the past two years for the applicant, including an OMB circular A-133 supplement as appropriate, any audit findings, corrective action plan, management letter and agency response.
- Applicant organizations which have not been audited must provide financial statements for each of the past two fiscal years and a year-todate statement certified by the applicant's Chief Financial Officer. Financial statements should include balance sheets and cash flow, revenue and expense and long-term debt statements.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Nonprofit organizations must provide copies of their IRS Form 990 (available from the IRS' Forms &amp; Publications website) for the prior two years. If the applicant is a new organization and only has one tax return, a copy of the prior year's IRS Form 990 will be sufficient.
- Outstanding HTF annual reports for previously funded projects.
- Current monitoring or other report from licensing agency, if license required.

See Section 507.1. Audit Requirements for future audit requirements.

## 206.1.3. Past Performance

An applicant's past performance and experience working with Commerce is a major factor in determining organizational capacity. The following performance areas are considered:

- Repeated delays in securing full financing for multiple projects.
- Accurate, complete and timely submission of reimbursement requests with appropriate back-up documentation.
- Progress on existing projects currently under development.
- Completion of prior projects within original proposed schedule.
- Completion of prior projects within original projected budget.
- Repeated requests to rush contracts (giving less than eight weeks to prepare contract documents once the Project Evaluation Report (PER) and/or delaying closings more than 60 days
- from the date provided on the PER).
- Overall performance of prior projects, including but not limited to:
- o Occupancy levels and population served, as compared to target population.
- o Maintenance of appropriate operating and replacement reserves.
- o Proper maintenance and planning for longer term capital needs.
- Accurate, complete and timely submission of annual reports.
- Timely remittance of loan repayments.

Organizations with projects in workout status will require additional evaluation and assessment. Refer to Section 504. Contract Amendments During Commitment Period for additional information.

## 206.2. Applicant Skills and Experience

If an applicant has not had relevant (e.g., project type, project size, funding structure) experience in affordable housing development within the past seven years, they must partner with a development consultant with relevant experience in affordable housing development. If an applicant has no prior experience with the Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard, they must use an experienced third party as the ESDS coordinator.

Applicants must demonstrate that the skills and experience of the development team and the property management team, and the capacity of the organization are appropriate to the size and complexity of the project. Commerce will review the following documentation:

- List of key property management staff and their qualifications and experience.
- List of key development team members and their qualifications and experience.

Applicant organizations, their Board of Directors, and development teams will be assessed for representative diversity and experience serving a diversity of populations.

## 206.3. Board Composition

All applicants must submit a list of board members, addresses, occupations and length of tenure on the board, including any terms of office prescribed by the organization. The board must have a minimum of three unrelated adults.

## 206.4. Board Resolution

Applicants must submit with the application a copy of the most recent signed board resolution or board minutes authorizing submittal of an HTF application, delegating signature authority for owners to sign, date, and execute HTF contracts.

## 206.5. Identity of Interest

Applicants' transactions involving HTF funds must be Arm's -Length Transactions, as defined in the Glossary. Applicants must disclose at the time of application, or any time after an award has been made, any financial, familial, or business relationship that may result in something less than an arm's length transaction in any HTF funded project. Failure to maintain this distance may result in termination of the award and any agreement, and a recapture of the funds.

## Section 207. Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard

These standards apply to all Housing Trust Fund affordable housing projects that have been competitively awarded and/or directly appropriated funds by the Legislature (unless otherwise required in the appropriation proviso).

## 207.1. Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard

The ESDS is a building performance standard required of all affordable housing projects or programs receiving capital funds from the Housing Trust Fund after July 1, 2008.

The ESDS was developed in compliance with RCW 39.35D.080 and contains 80 criteria safeguarding health and safety, increasing durability and sustainable living, preserving the environment, and increasing energy efficiency.

The ESDS webpage provides the latest edition of the ESDS Criteria, along with related forms, documents, and supporting information.

## 207.2 Third Party Verification During Development

## 1. Project Awarded

When a project receives an award of HTF funding, the Evergreen Coordinator will follow the process laid out in the project's Integrative Design Plan (IDP) to prepare the complete Evergreen Project Plan. The number of points being pursued by the project will be set at this point; projects must meet or exceed the minimum established for their type, unless alternate arrangements have been made with the Evergreen Program Manager.

## 2. Evergreen Project Plan (EPP) Approval

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

The EPP is sent to the HTF Project Manager assigned to the project. If there are questions or concerns, the EC must resolve the issues.

## 3. Coordination with the Third-Party Verifier (3PV)

The HTF Project Manager sends the approved EPP to the 3PV. The project sponsor sends the following to the 3PV:

- a. plans and specifications
- b. development budget
- c. construction cost estimate
- d. all other relevant construction documentation

## 4. 3PV Initial Oversight

The 3PV compares all documents to confirm that the features listed in the EPP are reflected appropriately. If there are questions or concerns, the 3PV notifies Commerce and contacts the EC to resolve the issues.

## 5. Evergreen Binder

The EC assembles and maintains the Evergreen Binder over the course of the project's active development phase, as described below.

## 6. Voucher Requests and Onsite Verification

Once the HTF contract is executed and any outstanding conditions have been met, the project sponsor can draw down funds using the current voucher reimbursement system.

The 3PV will schedule a construction phase kick-off meeting with the EC, with deliverables including:

- some form of verification plan,
- a communication protocol, and
- an agreement on who will be on site (the project rep) for 3PV visits.

Subsequent Owner, and EC should be cc'd on the 3PV field report when it is submitted so that issues can be addressed immediately, rather than once the report trickles through the system.

With each draw submittal to Lenders, the Evergreen Coordinator must submit an updated Evergreen Binder Matrix showing:

- the ESDS criteria they have approved documentation for,
- what they have approved in the field, and
- the date as of which the Table is current.

The EC will contact the 3PV to schedule an on-site inspection to verify the installation and implementation of ESDS features. On-site inspections will conclude with a debriefing between the 3PV and the project rep on findings, and any major concerns.

The 3PV will review the documentation, work underway on site, and work completed, and date the Evergreen Binder Matrix confirming compliance with the approved EPP.

The 3PV will report to Commerce, the EC, and any other parties deemed appropriate on the progress to date and note any discrepancies found in either the provided documentation or field conformance with the EPP and approved submittals.

If a problem surfaces during development regarding agreed upon ESDS features, Commerce may withhold payment of voucher requests until the issue is resolved.

## 7. Project Completion

At the end of development, the 3PV evaluates all the site visits and documentation reviewed and makes a final recommendation to Commerce regarding whether or not the project meets the ESDS requirements. Criteria in Section 8, except for 8.05, are verified by the HTF Project Manager, not the 3PV, as they can be completed after construction has ended. The HTF Project Manager may withhold payment of voucher requests until these documents are received. Once it is determined that all measures of the EPP have been met, Commerce will send a letter to the project sponsor confirming that the project has been built in compliance with the ESDS.

## 207.3 Program Documentation/Submittals

## Evergreen Project Plan

Once the project receives an allocation of HTF funds, the Evergreen Coordinator will compile and submit the EPP for review and approval to project manager. The EPP consists of the following:

- The EPP form, available on the ESDS website.
- Required attachments for each criterion. Each attachment should clearly indicate at the top of the page the applicable criterion. Attachments should show how the EPP meets requirements.

Access to HTF funds will be greatly restricted until the EPP has been approved by Commerce; no funds will be released in support of physical construction/rehabilitation activities, but may be released, at the Commerce Project Manager's discretion, in suppo rt of property acquisition, consultant work, or related activities. If at some point during development the project is found to be out of compliance with the ESDS, funds may be withheld by Commerce until the issue is resolved.

## Evergreen Binder

The Evergreen Binder contains the documents necessary for the 3PV to complete their on-site review of ESDS compliance; the EC is responsible its compilation and maintenance throughout construction. The Evergreen Binder is to be kept online at a file sharing site (such as DropBox or Google Docs), with review access granted to the 3PV, the on-site project team (the General Contractor, their Project Engineer, and any relevant designees and/or subcontractors), the Commerce Project Manager, and any others deemed appropriate. If the on-site project team finds a physical binder to be more effective, it is the responsibility of the EC to ensure that the physical binder is kept current.

The Evergreen Binder consists of:

- the EPP,
- the Evergreen Binder Matrix, and
- all documents required to confirm compliance.

The Evergreen Binder Matrix is an Excel-format document intended to assist tracking of documentation and completion of work covered by ESDS and is available on the ESDS webpage.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

If an ESDS measure calls for verification within the plans and specifications, the EC fills in the Spec Section number and Drawing Sheet number where the measure can be verified. This will help the 3PV efficiently find the verification they need.

At the end of construction, but preferably earlier, review access to the binder should be granted to the property management team. It can serve as a detailed account of what took place during construction and should be consulted when repairs and/or replacements are needed at the project.

## Photographic Documentation Guidelines

When photographic documentation is indicated as required, each photograph should:

- Be in focus
- Be properly exposed
- Be properly framed to suit the subject matter
- Be framed, where possible, to include an identifiable point of reference that places the photo on the specific site.
- Include a date stamp
- Include a size reference. In criteria where a particular level of insulation is required, for instance, include a ruler in the picture
- Be labeled or captioned to identify what the intended subject is.

If a system/assembly is being installed that will subsequently be covered up, i.e. by drywall, and it is deemed infeasible to schedule a timely onsite inspection by the 3PV, representative photos should be taken prior to covering.

## 207.4 Roles and Responsibilities

## Evergreen Advocate

The project sponsor must designate an Evergreen Advocate (EA) as their representative regarding the implementation of ESDS. The EA must be an employee of the sponsor organization. Their primary responsibility is to conduct the Project Priorities Survey, and subsequently to ensure that the findings of the PPS are applied as the project is developed. The EA role should preferably be filled by a person with executive authority but need not be the organization's executive director.

## Evergreen Coordinator

The project sponsor must designate an Evergreen Coordinator (EC) as their agent regarding the implementation of the ESDS. The EC does not need to be an employee of the sponsor organization. The EC role may be filled by the same person designated to be the EA.

The EC will have the following responsibilities:

- Understand the specifications for all the ESDS measures in the project.
- Coordinate the preparation of the EPP for Commerce approval.
- Prepare and maintain the online Evergreen Binder, ensuring that it is up to date with the appropriate technical submittals and accessible by the third-party verifier (3PV) and other relevant personnel
- If a physical copy of the Evergreen Binder is kept on the job site, it is also the EC's responsibility to ensure that the physical copy is kept up to date.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Communicate progress, coordinate site visits, and facilitate verification and quality control with the 3PV.
- Communicate with Commerce regarding EPP implementation during development.
- Oversee the development process to make sure that the ESDS features are implemented and correctly installed and troubleshoot any ESDS problems with the general contractor or subcontractors.

## Third Party Verifier

Commerce uses a 3PV to conduct on-site inspections, to include accessibility requirements in accordance to the 2010 ADA standards and UFAS, in a consistent, fair, and transparent manner. The goal is to verify the correct implementation of ESDS features without delaying construction. ESDS on-site inspections should be scheduled to coincide with draw inspections.

The responsibilities of the 3PV are:

- Initially review the project plans, specifications, and construction cost estimate to verify that the features and details in the EPP are included.
- Track the application and installation of the features and details of the Evergreen Project Plan during construction. Verify through direct observation that all measures are implemented and that the quality of the installation meets specifications. Additional documentation may be requested by the third-party verifier from the Evergreen Coordinator as needed.
- With each draw submittal to Lenders, 3PV will review the updated Evergreen Binder Matrix provided by the EC (as outlined above), to review that progress is being made and appropriate criteria are being met consistent with status of construction
- In each monthly draw/site visit report, 3PV will provide independent assessment, review and recommendation of EC status update statement.
- Alert and inform Commerce about any emerging issues.
- Provide limited technical assistance to the EC while on site.
- Determine whether each individual ESDS feature in the EPP is installed appropriately and submit the results of these observations to Commerce during and after construction.

## 207.5 Criterion Waivers

Criterion waivers may be granted to accommodate the broad variation in circumstances encountered by project teams. The Evergreen Coordinator of a project should discuss potential waivers with their assigned HTF Project Manager as soon as an appropriate issue is identified. The HTF Project Manager may involve the Evergreen Program Manager as part of this preliminary discussion.

Should a waiver be deemed appropriate, the project's Evergreen Coordinator must submit a formal letter requesting a waiver to the Evergreen Program Manager. In the letter, the Evergreen Coordinator must demonstrate that:

- the criterion creates an excessive hardship or is inadvisable or inappropriate for a specific project,

AND

- an alternative path is identified and will be implemented that meets the intent of the criteria.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

The Evergreen Program Manager will then provide a formal approval or denial of the request. If the former, the Evergreen Program Manager will state the compliance requirements for the proposed alternative path. Waiver approvals should be inserted into the appropriate location in the project's Evergreen Binder; a copy of the waiver approval will also be forwarded to the 3PV.

## 207.6 Compliance

Should a completed project fail to meet threshold requirements, including verification of mandatory ESDS criteria, the project sponsor will be responsible for bringing the project up to the standard or implementing alternatives accepted and approved by Commerce. Failure to meet ESDS requirements at project completion may affect consideration of future funding requests.

The project sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the project is operated according to the Management Plan and the Owner's Manual. HTF field monitors will visit the project periodically while the HTF contract is in effect and assess whether or not the project is being managed according to these approved documents.

Projects that claimed and were awarded ESDS points based on services outside the scope of the project itself (e.g. Transit routes, the location of a Farmers' Market) will NOT be adversely affected regarding compliance should such services move, or in the case of planned services (specifically, broadband connectivity) fail to be extended to the project site.

## CHAPTER 3: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

## Section 300. Purpose

This chapter describes the application process, including some general procedures for application submission, notification of funding decisions, and project debriefing. Refer to Chapter 2. Funding Guidelines for a general description of the criteria used for reviewing, evaluating, and prioritizing applications for funding. The information provided by applicants in their application is the basis for all funding decisions. All HTF application forms are available for download from the Commerce Funding Opportunities webpage.

All applicants should carefully follow the requirements listed in the HTF solicitation for applications, the NOFA, and the application forms (including published addenda, if any). Requirements listed in the solicitation and NOFA will often supplement or supersede the information provided in this Handbook. However, in any and every instance where there is a conflict between this Handbook and a solicitation or a NOFA, the solicitation or the NOFA will supersede this Handbook. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain HTF staff guidance, prior to submitting their HTF application, in any instance where such a conflict could affect their application.

## 300.1. Assistance Available Prior to Application

Housing Trust Fund staff is available to provide information about application and funding requirements to project developers. Staff can address questions concerning HTF guidelines and procedures. Applicants have sole responsibility for drafting their HTF applications.

Before you begin preparation of an HTF application, we recommend the following:

- Begin the process early.
- Review the HTF Handbook and the NOFA or solicitation thoroughly to understand all the requirements and the HTF guidelines and procedures.
- Subscribe for Housing Division program update emails.
- Attend orientation, public webinars, and review Frequently Asked Questions on the website.
- If you have questions, contact HTF staff for clarification as early as possible.

Once a NOFA or solicitation is published, the ability of Commerce staff to answer questions/provide assistance on topics related to the specific NOFA is restricted due to state procurement guidelines. Therefore, once published, communication related to a NOFA will be conducted exclusively through the HTFAPP email inbox, and any information so provided will be published to the Commerce website via an FAQ/Q&amp;A document.

## 300.1.1 Preconstruction Technical Assistance

The Housing Division may have external Technical Assistance Consultants available to provide preconstruction technical assistance to eligible recipients seeking to develop affordable housing, as allowed by RCW 43.185A.170. These preconstruction technical assistance services may include a wide variety of activities including the following examples:

- a. Financial planning
- b. Project design
- c. Site search

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- d. Due Diligence
- e. Securing non-state funds for project development
- f. Forming local partnerships and support

Please refer to the capacity building website for information about what technical assistance may be currently available.

In addition, the Housing Trust Fund and other programs within Commerce may periodically offer preconstruction funding opportunities. If available, these funds would support affordable housing projects during the development process prior to an application to HTF's typical capital funding programs. Open funding opportunities are found on the Commerce webpage.

Note: Commerce administers preconstruction or predevelopment contracts (those that do not yield a housing unit) differently than HTF Traditional and uses a non-capital contract template. If the award exceeds $250,000, the contract may require securitization for a period of ten years or more. The award terms are generally made as Recoverable Grants (subject to fund source eligibility). Section 202.5.1. Eligibility of Prior Costs does not apply to predevelopment contracts.

Organizations interested in more information about funding opportunities currently available can email htfcapacitybuilding@commerce.wa.gov.

## 300.2. Other Funding Sources

## 300.2.1. Coordination with Other Funding Sources

The HTF applications review will include coordination and timing of investment with other local, state, and federal funding sources to ensure complete and ready projects. The Combined Funders' Application (CFA) is used by more than a dozen local funders and WSHFC. HTF's awards must be at a level to complete the financing package which requires local and other funding to be sourced prior to, or simultaneously with Commerce.

Confirming and verifying that a project is or can be fully funded often acts as a final threshold in the award decision-making process.

## 300.2.2. Predevelopment Financing

Community development financial institutions (CDFIs), including Washington Community Reinvestment Association (WCRA), Enterprise and Impact Capital administer programs offering predevelopment loans and technical assistance for affordable housing nonprofit developers in Washington.

The Washington State Housing Finance Commission administers a Land Acquisition Program (LAP) specifically provides low-cost financing to help with the acquisition of property for affordable housing (see website).

## Section 301. Process Overview

## 301.1. Staging of Applications

Commerce maintains a biennium investment plan that provides details on when funding rounds will occur, what types of funding will be available, and what programmatic priorities there will be. This

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook document will be updated annually, at least, following the adoption of the state's capital budget (March in Even Years; May in Odd Years). As much funding as possible will be available in a consolidated public funders application approximately 90 days after the legislature concludes session (June/July). However, additional funding rounds will be scheduled depending on the specific requirements.

## 301.1.1 Pre-Applications

HTF will generally solicit pre-applications every year or every other year via survey and by posting on the Commerce website. Pre-applications are used to identify a pool of projects that appear viable, ready, and eligible for funding in the current round. Sometimes the pre-application solicitation may also solicit projects that are in the pipeline for potential application in the following funding cycle (typically within a biennium). Pre-applications will not be scored, nor will funding decisions for projects be made based on them.

Submitting a pre-application is not considered a prerequisite to applying in the traditional or other funding rounds. All interested applicants will be welcome to apply in all/any funding rounds. However, it is in an organization's best interest to submit a pre -application, as Commerce will publish the list of pre-applications received to assist its public funding partners and increase coordination of their resources, as well as provide the Legislature with a current need inventory.

## 301.1.2 Competitive Applications

HTF will solicit HTF comprehensive competitive applications via the release of a NOFA, which will lay out the specific requirements of the funding cycle. The NOFA will be distributed via email and will be posted on the Commerce website. Requirements listed in the NOFA may supplement or supersede the information provided in this Handbook. However, in any and every instance where there is a conflict between this Handbook and a NOFA, the NOFA will supersede this Handbook. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain HTF staff guidance, prior to submitting their HTF application, in any instance where such a conflict could affect their application.

The HTF application itself is far more comprehensive than the pre-application. It is the document (or rather set of documents) upon which HTF funding decisions will be made. It is at this stage that detailed project budgets, service plans, development documents (including architectural renderings), and thirdparty studies are required. The application will include the Combined Funders Application, a jointly administered application that assists applicants in submitting projects to multiple funders. Commerce facilitates the annual update of these forms.

## 301.2. Project Review

The HTF review team will read and evaluate applications to determine to what extent the proposed projects meet the current HTF's thresholds and priorities, including but not limited to:

- Timely and complete application submittal
- Soundness of project concept and design
- Target population and need
- Financial feasibility and long-term viability of the project
- Cost-effectiveness and level of HTF investment
- Project viability (full funding) and readiness to proceed
- Organizational experience, capacity, and past performance with HTF

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

## The application review process and the evaluation criteria will be described in detail in the NOFAs.

Typically, it will involve three main phases representing the three main decision points in the decisionmaking process:

- 1) ensuring that all thresholds are met;
- 2) applying priorities via a scoring and ranking system; and
- 3) applying a final threshold to ensure the projects' viability and full funding or meeting other unique or special requirements, including coordination with the other public funders (city, county, state, federal).

The geographical regions of the state must be considered and balanced when developing recommendations for funding, so applications will generally only compete against other applications within their geographical areas, e.g., urban vs. rural, King County vs. other urban.

Applicants should be aware that each Capital Budget appropriation might dictate new requirements and thresholds in a funding cycle. Therefore, the HTF project evaluation criteria are expected to change and evolve over the years, as HTF seeks to align it to new priorities (e.g., Capital Budget), stakeholder input, and to the ever-changing landscape of affordable housing and homelessness in our state.

HTF staff may need to adjust its evaluation process to ensure that only the most competitive projects that have local support, are fully funded, are constructionready, and that meet the state's priorities and requirements receive funding. To achieve this goal, the process used to evaluate projects will be reviewed each year prior to evaluating HTF applications, as well as after the close of each funding cycle.

During the review process, HTF reserve the right to contact applicants in rare instances to obtain clarification regarding their responses to questions and/or submission of required attachments. Refer to Section 303.4. Omitted Documentation and Missing Information. In addition, the HTF review team will consult with other public funders to assess local priorities and their degree of support (financial and non-financial).

## 301.2.1. Threshold Waivers

All applicants will need to follow the NOFA instructions and ensure that they meet all the thresholds identified in the NOFA. Not meeting the required thresholds may mean that an application will not be reviewed for funding. Commerce will exercise its discretion in issuing threshold waivers only in rare and extraordinary circumstances. Applicants should consult the HTF Handbook and with HTF staff prior to requesting a waiver. Applicants submitting repeat applications may have elements of the application that can be exempted.

The waiver process will be defined in the NOFA. Waiver decisions will be made public during the application funding cycle.

## 301.3. Notification of Funding Decisions

The NOFA will include an estimated timeline for award notifications. They will generally occur approximately three months after the submission of the HTF applications.

A list of the applicants receiving awards will be posted on the Commerce website and all applicants will be notified by email when the awards list is posted. Commerce will follow with formal funding award

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook letters sent to each applicant, which will include the conditions of the award and the name of the HTF Project Manager assigned to each project.

Commerce will also forward the award list upon request, in electronic or in hard copy form, to all interested parties.

## 301.4. Project Debriefing

Failure to receive HTF funding is not necessarily a reflection on the quality of a project, but may be due to specific factors, including lack of available funds and the overall competitiveness of the funding round. Applicants not receiving HTF funding may request a meeting with staff to discuss why the project was not funded and receive specific feedback on their application.

If, after meeting with staff and learning the reasons for non-funding, applicants believe there is a consequential misunderstanding of the project specifics that will jeopardize the project or other critical funding, those concerns may be discussed with the Assistant Director of the Housing Division.

## Section 302. Pre-Application Requirements

Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation for pre-applications, the following instructions must be followed to submit a complete pre-application. However, in any and every instance where there is a conflict between this Handbook and the solicitation, the solicitation will supersede this Handbook. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain HTF staff guidance, prior to submitting their preapplication, in any instance where such a conflict could affect their application.

The pre-application generally consists of an online survey available from the Housing Trust Fund Funding Opportunities webpage. The application is structured to accommodate both Multifamily/Rental and Homeownership projects. The pre-application is for informational and planning purposes only.

## Section 303. Competitive Applications Requirements

Unless otherwise specified in the Application NOFA, the following instructions must be followed to submit a complete HTF competitive application. However, in any and every instance where there is a conflict between this Handbook and the NOFA, the NOFA will supersede this Handbook. It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain HTF staff guidance, prior to submitting their HTF application, in any instance where such a conflict could affect their application.

The Application consists of the published Application forms, as well as all materials required as attachments, on Commerce's website . Depending on the HTF goals or legislative requirements in each funding cycle, requirements may be added or waived. Any such modification will be communicated via the relevant NOFA.

Completion of a competitive HTF application often requires significant time and expense. Commerce recognizes that applicants may incur costs for preparing for and submitting their applications. While some capital project predevelopment costs may be eligible for retroactive reimbursement once a project is awarded and under contract (see Section 202.5. Eligible/Ineligible Costs), all applicants should be aware that Commerce cannot be held responsible for predevelopment or application preparation costs in response to a Solicitation or NOFA, regardless of whether funding is awarded.

## 303.1 Submitting the Application

All application submittals must carefully follow the NOFA instructions, must be complete, include all the required documentation and attachments, and must be submitted to Commerce by the date and time indicated in the NOFA.

HTF publishes two sets of application forms: one for Homeownership projects and one for Multifamily/Rental projects. The Homeownership forms may only be used for applications that provide assistance to low-income first-time homebuyers (as defined in RCW 43.185A.010). The Multifamily/Rental application forms may be used for all other housing models, including multifamily rental housing, group-homes, scatter-site rental housing, shelters, transitional housing, seasonal farmworker housing, etc.

The Multifamily/Rental application is modified on occasion to accommodate new provisos and special initiatives. In general, the Combined Funders Application is a common building block for all project-types so that multiple local funders can also underwrite projects without creating additional forms. Whenever possible, Commerce will provide instructions to simplify the application and to provide pre-application technical supports.

## 303.2 Geographic Determination

The geographic location of a project is important to HTF, both in terms of the statutory requirement to commit 30 percent of funds to rural areas and in terms of which Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard criteria apply to a project. As early as is f easible, consult the definitions of 'Rural' and 'Urban' in the Glossary to determine in which region a project site is located. If it is not clear whether a project site would be considered Rural or Urban, please contact the HTF staff for a determination, prior to the application deadline.

## 303.3. Financial Information

If necessary, HTF staff will request applicants to provide updated audit reports and financial statements. Applicants must submit the requested information by carefully following the HTF staff's instructions.

Financial documents that may be requested by HTF staff include:

- Audit reports for each of the past two years for the applicant, including an OMB circular A-133 supplement as appropriate, any audit findings, corrective action plan, management letter and agency response.
- Applicant organizations which have not been audited must provide financial statements for each of the past two fiscal years and a year-todate statement certified by the applicant's Chief Financial Officer. Financial statements should include balance sheets and cash flow, revenue and expense and long-term debt statements.
- Nonprofit organizations must provide copies of their IRS Form 990 for the prior two years. If the applicant is a new organization and only has one tax return, a copy of the prior year's IRS Form 990 will be sufficient.
- Outstanding HTF annual reports for previously funded projects.

## 303.3.1. Additional Information Requirements for New Applicants

In addition to the above financial information, nonprofit applicants who have not previously received an HTF award or managed a HTF contract must provide the following:

- Certification from the Washington State Secretary of State that the applicant is registered to do business in Washington as a nonprofit organization in accordance with RCW 24.03.
- Letter from the Internal Revenue Service that designates the applicant as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization.
- List of Board members, addresses, occupations and length of tenure on the board including any terms of office prescribed by the organization.
- By-laws that include a clear housing purpose.
- Letters from other capital public funders (city, county, state, federal) attesting to their organization being in good standing with those funders.

## 303.4. Omitted Documentation and Missing Information

Submitting a complete and timely application, including all the required attachments, is the applicant's sole responsibility. Applicants are required to self-certify that all required application documents have been submitted by including signed and scanned copies of the Self-Certification of Threshold Requirements and Affidavit Affirmation pages. Unless otherwise stated in the NOFA, in rare circumstances HTF staff may determine during the application review that critical information has not been included as itemized in the checklists, NOFAs, or the application forms, and may at its sole discretion reach out to the applicant and give them the opportunity to provide the additional materials required.

## 303.4.1. Process for Omissions and Corrections

Unless otherwise described in the NOFA, in rare circumstances HTF staff at their own discretion may reach out to applicants and inquire about omitted or missing application materials or if necessary, clarifications are needed. The process is as follows:

1. Commerce will notify applicants via email during the review process when their application is found to be incomplete or when HTF staff discover issues that require clarifications or additional information to be addressed.
2. Applicants will have 48 hours (or two business days) from the time the email is sent to submit missing materials. See Note below.
3. Applicants who fail to submit the missing items within the time allowed or who submit items considered unresponsive to the HTF guidelines or the HTF staff instructions will not receive further consideration in the application review process .
4. Applicants must be aware that all documentation provided to Commerce is considered discoverable via a public records request, except where specifically exempted by law.

Note: Commerce will use its discretion to allow additional time in instances where it is not possible for the applicant to retrieve the necessary items within 48 hours, provided that the need for the additional time is documented via: (1) a reply to HTF's notifi cation received by HTF within the 48-hour period and HTF has granted the allowance; or (2) evidence that the email recipient did not receive Commerce's email (e.g., emergency circumstances, unexpected leave, etc.). If HTF staff receives an out-of-office or failed-todeliver email in response to our request, HTF staff may seek other individuals in the applicant's organization or the developer's organization, as applicable.

## CHAPTER 4: CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT

## Section 400. Purpose

This chapter outlines the contract development and management process followed by Housing Division staff from the time of award until a project is placed in service. These policies apply to all affordable housing projects that received a competitive award or a directly appropriated award from the Legislature (unless otherwise required in the appropriation proviso). All references to 'award' shall mean 'award or directly appropriated amount.'

## Section 401. Pre-Contract Development

Pre-contracting is the period from award notification through execution of the contract. For direct appropriations, award notification is the same as the effective date of the budget bill.

## 401.1. Assignment of Project

All award recipients will receive a letter from Department of Commerce (Commerce) specifying the amount of the award, any conditions on the award, and the name and contact information of the HTF Project Manager assigned to the project.

Commerce will notify its third-party reviewer of the award, project contact, and assigned HTF Project Manager. The role of the third-party reviewer is described in Section 403.3. Construction Review and Inspection.

Contractors and development consultants are expected to work closely with the HTF Project Manager and third-party reviewer during pre-contracting, project implementation and placed-in-service activities. Failure on the part of the contractor or development team to maintain communication with the HTF Project Manager, make continuous progress toward agreed-upon timelines, or provide required documentation in a timely manner will reflect poorly on their capacity and performance. Failure to follow through in these areas may adversely affect the contractor's ability to secure future HTF financing or in a breach of the contract.

## 401.2. HTF Project Manager Responsibilities

The HTF Project Manager is the primary contact for communications related to negotiations, contract development and execution, disbursement of funds, and any other issues throughout the development phase of the project. HTF Project Manager responsibilities include:

- Communications related to specific terms and conditions of the grant or loan, including repayment provisions.
- Communication and coordination regarding the development and execution of the contract and related legal documents, including documents that impact the contract (e.g. LLP operating agreements). (Note: Final language in all legal documents is subject to the approval of the state's Assistant Attorney General.)
- Ensuring all conditions of the award and pre-contracting requirements are met prior to contract execution.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Review and approval of the final project budget and schedule prior to contract execution, and any revisions that occur during development.
- Review and approval of all draw requests and back-up documentation.
- General oversight of the project until issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.

## 401.3. Project Initiation

The HTF Project Manager will contact the contractor to discuss the proposed award terms, uses of HTF funds, any identified conditions or potential issues, documentation needed prior to contracting, and the expected timeframe for contract execution. For projects funded through the HOME and National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF) programs, refer to HOME/NHTF Rental Program Guidelines and HOME/NHTF Rental Management Handbook.

Prior to contract execution, the HTF Project Manager will work closely with the contractor to ensure all pre-contracting requirements are met, including but not limited to:

- HTF award conditions that must be met or a timeframe for addressing outstanding issues. Depending on the specific conditions or requirements, Commerce may approve execution of a contract but withhold disbursement of funds until the conditions are met (e.g. compliance with Washington State Executive Order 21-02, Archeological and Cultural Resources).
- If HOME or NHTF funds are used, specific pre-contracting requirements must be met in accordance with applicable guidelines for these funds (refer to the HOME/NHTF Rental Program Guidelines and HOME/NHTF Rental Management Handbook).
- All necessary capital financing must be secured and evidence of commitments provided from other funders, including tax credit investors. If any conditions apply to the commitment of other funds, they must be identified and evidence provided that the conditions have been met.
- The third-party construction review must be initiated, including review and approval of the project plans and specifications, Evergreen Plan, construction budget and documents, and establishment of an inspection schedule. (Refer to Section 403.3. Construction Review and Inspection.)
- The HTF Project Manager will request any documentation needed via the Project Data Sheet (PDS) and confirm the timeframe for submission of these documents.
- The contractor must verify whether the project is affecting a property already within the HTF portfolio and that information has been provided to Asset Management through the Portfolio Inbox.

## 401.4 Issuance of Final Contract Documents

- Prior to drafting contract documents,
- o Parties must clarify and agree to repayment terms.
- o The HTF Project Manager must review a final development budget and operating pro forma prior to approval, using a maximum of two percent (2%) inflation factor for all sources of income. All operating expenses will be underwritten with an inflation factor of at least three percent (3%).
- o Reimbursement requests for costs incurred prior to contract execution will require prior approval. (Refer to Section 202.5.1. Eligibility of Prior Costs.)
- o Parties must agree upon the developer fee drawdown schedule. (Refer to Section 204.7. Developer Fees.)

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- o The contractor must identify a realistic target date for when the project will be placed in service. This date will be used to establish the commitment period of the contract (Refer to Section 406. Placed In Service).
- Other pre-contractual requirements listed in the competitive award letter and/or those identified in the direct appropriation proviso and in the documents received from the Legislature (such as scope of work, legislative intent, special requirements).

The HTF Project Manager must be notified immediately of any issues that could cause a delay to the start of the project, including the anticipated length of the delay and any actions being taken as a result.

## 401.5. Material Changes to Project

The contractor must notify Commerce of material changes to the project at least 30 days prior to drafting of the contract. Such changes are subject to review and approval and could potentially result in amendment or withdrawal of the HTF award. Material changes include, but are not limited to, changes to target population, project location, number of units, total development cost, ownership entity, and project schedule, or the loss of a major source of funds.

## 401.6. Scoping Meetings

If multiple public funders are involved in a project, the contractor is responsible for scheduling at least two (2) scoping meetings prior to contract document execution:

- Pre-bid Meeting - within 6 weeks of award notification
- Post-bid Meeting - within 30 days of bid and at least 30 days prior to closing to contract execution

Each scoping meeting is typically a conference call that includes, at a minimum, the project sponsor, developer, and representatives of each of the public funders. The purpose is to bring all parties up to date, discuss potential changes to the project budget or scope of work, and reach a common understanding of timelines, key milestones, and conditions for release of funds.

## Section 402. Contract Development

The contract development phase includes contract drafting, review, and execution. Contractors should allow eight (8) weeks between getting an approved Project Data Sheet (PDS) and final execution. The HTF Project Manager will coordinate with an HTF Contract Specialist (CS) who will prepare documents, manage internal reviews, coordinate the execution of contract documents and manage escrow.

The timeframe may be abbreviated, but will depend on HTF staff workload, priorities, and type of funding. Commerce considers requests to rush legal documents or extensive legal negotiations as performance issues evaluated during funding rounds.

The HTF contract is comprised of two parts: Specific Terms and Conditions and General Terms and Conditions . The HTF contract and related legal documents have been internally pre-approved. The General Terms and Conditions are not negotiable. Limited revisions to the Specific Terms and Conditions or other legal documents may be allowed, as noted below. Substitution or addition of non-HTF documents will require a longer time for additional review.

## 402.1. Contract Draft

Attachment B - Scope of Work of the HTF contract General Terms and Conditions includes projectspecific details that must be negotiated with the HTF Project Manager prior to drafting the contract.

Once contract terms have been agreed upon and pre-contract conditions have been satisfied, the HTF Project Manager will send the completed Project Data Sheet (PDS) to the HTF Contract Specialist (CS), who will draft the contract documents. The priority of each contract will be determined by Commerce based on closing dates, project readiness, and the workload of the CS staff. The contractor should provide all requested terms and changes to its underlying and related contract documents and give no less than three (3) weeks prior notice of its anticipated closing date. Requesting edits or changes to contract terms, or providing amended documents, after this date will impact Commerce's ability to review and approve changes prior to the closing date, for which Commerce does not accept any responsibility or liability.

The CS will send draft contract documents to the HTF Project Manager for review. The HTF Project Manager may fill in additional information or make changes as applicable. After the HTF Project Manager has approved the initial draft of the contract and related documents, the CS will send them to the contractor for review via email.

## 402.2. Contractor Review

The timeline for final execution of the contract is largely dependent on how long it takes the contractor to review and approve the draft contract. It may vary dramatically, depending on other funding sources and the extent of third-party review. Unless an extended period is approved by the HTF Project Manager, contractors should complete their reviews within 15 working days to facilitate timely execution of the contract and related documents. The CS will forward the contract to the CS Supervisor for review and approval by management.

## 402.2.1. Revisions to Contract Documents

Proposed changes to HTF contract documents related to loan terms or scope of work must first be discussed with the HTF Project Manager. Revisions solely to improve the accuracy or clarity of terms may be considered and approved by Commerce staff.

More substantive changes to the Specific Terms and Conditions require internal review and approval and should be expected to add up to three (3) weeks to the timeline for execution. Requests must be made in writing with an explanation and include any relevant documentation to support the revision. If the revisions are not accepted, the CS will inform the HTF Project Manager about the issue or issues so that the HTF Project Manager can negotiate revised language with the contractor or rescind the award.

Once the HTF Project Manager and contractor agree on the revised contract language, the CS will finalize and prepare the HTF contract and related documents for execution.

## 402.3. Contract Execution

It is the contractor's responsibility to be aware of their deadlines, keep their HTF Project Manager informed in advance, and allow sufficient time for contract execution. Contractors should allow a minimum of two (2) weeks to obtain final signatures, once all negotiations have been completed and the contract and related documents are finalized. Commerce cannot guarantee its ability to respond to rush requests. Requesting edits or changes to contract terms, or providing amended documents, after this

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook date will impact Commerce's ability to review and approve changes prior to the closing date, for which Commerce does not accept any responsibility or liability.

## 402.3.1. Contractor Signatures

Once finalized, the CS will send the HTF contract and related legal documents to the contractor via email, or in some cases DocuSign, for signature. Related documents include, but are not limited to, a promissory note, deed of trust, low-income housing covenant and, if applicable, assignment, assumption, and consent agreement. Form W-9, which verifies the contractor's tax ID number, maybe requested from the contractor prior to contract drafting; it is required prior to submitting the first invoice for payment.

The contractor will sign and return the contract (two originals), promissory note, deed of trust, and any other requested documents to Commerce. In the case of a tax credit project, the contractor additionally will sign and return the assignment, assumption, and consent agreement to Commerce.

## 402.3.2. Contract Execution and Document Distribution

Commerce will execute the contract, and when applicable, the assignment, assumption, and consent agreement, when all conditions have been met by the contractor and the contractor has signed all documents. The CS Supervisor will route the contract to the Assistant Director (AD) of the Housing Division for signature. This process may take up to seven (7) working days.

The date the AD signs the contract is the official date of execution.

Once the contract is executed, the Contracts Fiscal Team Escrow Desk will send an extra signed copy of the document back to contractor and forward the executed deed, covenant and, if applicable, the assignment, assumption and consent agreement to escrow and/or title company for closing, together with closing instructions (refer to Section 402.4.1 Escrow Instructions and Section 402.4.3. Recording of Documents).

## 402.4. Closing

## 402.4.1. Escrow Instructions

The Contracts Fiscal Team Escrow Desk will draft escrow instructions for projects using HTF funds for acquisition and for other situations, including, at a minimum:

- Identify the priority of document recordation and distribution;
- Direct the contractor to pay the recording fees; and
- Direct the contractor to ensure the purchase of extended lender's title insurance with Commerce as the beneficiary.

## 402.4.2. Insurance

The contractor must purchase extended lender's title insurance in the amount of the HTF lien under the deed of trust, and property and liability insurance as outlined in the current HTF contract General Terms and Conditions . Evidence of all insurance commitments must be provided to Commerce.

The HTF contract will not be executed until evidence of liability insurance has been provided.

## 402.4.3. Recording of Documents

The low-income housing covenant, deed of trust, and, if applicable, assignment, assumption and consent agreement, and all other relevant and recordable documents, once executed, must be recorded promptly in accordance with Commerce's escrow and/or recording Instructions . If the project includes acquisition of property, executed documents should be recorded simultaneously with the closing on the acquisition.

Documents must be recorded in the following order: (1) covenant, (2) deed of trust, and (3) other documents. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that all documents are recorded in the correct order and the originals returned promptly to Commerce.

Commerce may withhold payment of HTF funds pending receipt of the original recorded documents.

## 402.4.4. Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT)

It is the responsibility of the contractor to authorize receipt of payments from the State of Washington via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) by completing and submitting a Statewide Payee Registration form to the Department of Enterprise Services (DES). The process to register as a Statewide Payee is also described on the Department of Enterprise Services (DES) webpage.

## 402.4.5. First Voucher (see also Section 403.4. Voucher Request Processing)

Commerce will provide the HTF contractor with an electronic copy of the HTF voucher request form with appropriate line items. The HTF Project Manager and the contractor will discuss the method of payment (e.g., warrant or electronic fund transfer) and other information that may be needed before payment can be authorized.

## 402.4.5(a). Required Documentation If First Voucher Is for Acquisition

If HTF funds are used for acquisition, the preliminary closing statement prepared by the title company or escrow agent will serve as back-up documentation for the voucher. An appraisal may be required if it was not included with the HTF Application. The final closing statement should be submitted when available. The HTF Project Manager should be notified of upcoming closing dates well in advance to ensure availability of funds.

## 402.4.6. Administration Fee and Monitoring Fee

Per RCW 43.185A.140(5)(b), Commerce may use up to three percent (3%) of the appropriations from capital bond proceeds or other new appropriations for affordable housing investments for administrative costs associated with application, distribution, and project development activities of the Affordable Housing Program. This 3% reduction is calculated and withheld prior to the release of a NOFA. For Direct Appropriations, these funds are withheld and the contract reduced from the full legislative appropriation (effectively, contractors receive 97% of a direct appropriation).

## Section 403. Contract Management During Project Development

The purpose of this section is to outline the process for managing the oversight of acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of a project from contract execution to completion of all activities described in the HTF contract Scope of Work .

## 403.1. Timelines and Project Schedule

The project work schedule is used to determine the completion date which, in turn, determines the start of the commitment period of the contract. Changes to the schedule must be documented in a revised schedule and sent to the HTF Project Manager for approval. The project work schedule must include key benchmark dates for completion of the project. Key benchmark dates include:

- Site control secured
- Environmental review completion
- Relocation activities (if applicable)
- Awarded dates for all proposed funding sources
- Capital finance closing target
- Evergreen Project Plan/ESDS compliance target
- Construction start
- Project lease up activities

The project must be completed according to the approved project schedule. Additional timelines may be identified as special conditions in the contract based on project type and financing.

If the project is placed in service considerably later than was originally projected (generally six (6) months or more), the contract documents may be amended to adjust the commitment period of the project.

## 403.2. Site Visits

Site visits will be conducted at the discretion of the HTF Project Manager or when requested by the contractor.

## 403.3. Construction Review and Inspection

Commerce contracts with a third-party reviewer to provide pre-construction review, construction draw review, and to conduct site inspections during construction. A third-party review will occur prior to the approval of each construction draw, which may include an on-site inspection of the work performed (see also Section 403.4. Voucher Request Processing)

The contractor is responsible for determining applicability and undertaking all necessary actions related to prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. (Refer to Section 201.5. Prevailing Wage, and Section 201.6. Use of the Apprenticeship Program.)

The contractor is responsible for ensuring compliance with Washington State Executive Order 21-02, Archeological and Cultural Resources. Documentation of compliance will be required before HTF funds may be drawn. (Refer to Section 201.7. Archaeological and Cultural Resources.)

## 403.3.1. Pre-Construction Review -Project Evaluation Report (PER)

The third-party reviewer will conduct a pre-construction review and produce a Project Evaluation Report (PER) prior to the start of construction. The purpose of the pre-construction review is to:

- Ensure the budget is adequate for the proposed project based on a review of the project's plans and specifications;
- Determine whether or not the proposed plans are appropriate for the project; and

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Verify whether or not the plans and specifications incorporate the ESDS mandatory and optional features.

The HTF Project Manager determines the timeframe for the third-party review, depending on the readiness of the plans and specifications and other negotiated conditions. The following steps are involved in the third-party pre-construction review process:

1. The HTF Project Manager requests a pre-construction review and provides the name of the contractor, the name of the project, and the contract number to the third-party reviewer.
2. The third-party reviewer provides the contractor with a list of the items needed to complete the review.
3. The third-party reviewer oversees the review by an approved third-party inspector and sends a report (Project Evaluation Report, PER) of its review to the HTF Project Manager. The HTF Project Manager may send the review to the contractor to address any concerns raised.
4. If Commerce is a permanent take-out lender, HTF staff or a sub-contractor may conduct a site inspection prior to closing on the permanent loan. Commerce may contract with a professional inspection or commissioning service to verify that project completion satisfies the housing standards and satisfies other agreed upon conditions and features.

## 403.3.2. Construction Review

During the construction phase, the third-party reviewer will review draws against the budget to determine the adequacy of funds in the reserve/escrow to complete the project and monitor costs for appropriateness, including the use of contingency funds. The third-party reviewer will request a disbursement control budget (budget spreadsheet) from the contractor to track project costs.

For each construction draw request, or as requested by the HTF Project Manager, the third-party reviewer will engage a third-party inspector to perform an inspection of the property. Inspections may be done less frequently as agreed to by the HTF Project Manager. The objectives of the third-party inspection is to:

- Ensure costs included in the draw request are in conformance with the construction contract and other construction project documentation such as permits, plans and specifications.
- Provide third party verification of the ESDS requirements, including review of the Evergreen Binder on site, for completion of items as construction progresses. (Refer to Section 207. Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard)
- Produce a report detailing the progress of the project, any deviations from the plans and specifications or change orders, and compliance with ESDS and applicable accessibility standards. Final verification of compliance with ESDS will be provided at project completion.

The purpose of the third-party review is to determine the source of costs, compliance and quality of construction, and provide a recommendation for funding the draw. The third-party reviewer will forward the draw review memo to the HTF Project Manager with a report on the project's progress, including findings or other items of concern, apprenticeship participation if applicable, and a recommendation for funding.

## 403.4. Voucher Request Processing

The HTF Project Manager reviews and approves all invoice vouchers. The HTF Project Manager will decide whether each invoice or bill is an eligible cost. If an invoice or bill is determined to be an ineligible

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook cost, the amount must be subtracted from the total requested. The contractor may be asked to submit an explanation of budget changes. Allowable costs incurred prior to the execution of a contract may be reimbursed when approval is granted by Commerce. (Refer to Section 202.5.1. Eligibility of Prior Costs.)

The basic criteria for approval of invoice vouchers are:

- The payee must be the nonprofit organization with which Commerce has a direct contractual relationship. Vouchers must be signed by an authorized individual from the contractor's organization (electronic signatures are acceptable).
- The HTF contract must be fully executed and applicable requirements met (e.g. proof of liability insurance, approved Evergreen Project Plan, etc.).
- All invoice vouchers must have back-up documentation justifying the amount requested. This can be in the form of an approved closing statement, invoices for services rendered and materials delivered, or bills from the contractor for project management and developer fees. Incorrect or incomplete vouchers may be returned to the contractor for correction and resubmission.
- Draw requests must correspond with the development budget categories. For each invoice voucher submitted, an invoice voucher summary must list each invoice with Development Budget line-item detail.

Stored materials will be approved for disbursement on a draw-by-draw basis. No offsite-stored material will be funded as part of the draw without approval and subject to additional requirements such as Bill of Sale, financing statements, evidence of insurance and inspection of materials to determine they are segregated by project from other stored material.

Construction contingencies are to be used for unanticipated costs unless otherwise approved by the HTF Project Manager. If HTF funds are allocated in the budget for construction contingency, the contractor must provide documentation and a full explanation for the use of the contingency.

The process for reimbursement is as follows:

1. Original vouchers and back-up documentation must be submitted to the HTF Project Manager. Copies of all vouchers and back-up documentation for any expenditure must be submitted to the third-party reviewer for review prior to HTF Project Manager approval.
2. The HTF Project Manager and the third-party reviewer will determine if any Development Budget line items are being overspent. If a contractor proposes to exceed an original budget line item by 10 percent or more, the contractor may be asked to submit a revised Development Budget and a narrative explaining the revisions.
3. Once the HTF Project Manager approves payment of eligible costs, the voucher is signed and sent to the Commerce fiscal office for payment.
4. The contractor should allow up to 18 business days to receive payment after submitting a properly completed invoice voucher.
5. The HTF Project Manager may require that all legal documentation, updated budget, updated work schedule, lender's title insurance, and other required documentation be submitted before the final draw is approved.

See also Section 204.7. Developer Fees, Section 204.11. Hold Back of Funds, and Section 402.4.4. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

## 403.5. Contract Oversight

Oversight of the contract to monitor the progress of the project during the development phase is primarily carried out through ongoing communication with the contractor and developer, receipt and review of required documentation, and through the third party construction review process (see Section 403.3. Construction Review and Inspection).

In addition to collecting all the required documentation, project oversight and progress review are done through the voucher process. Back-up documentation is reviewed for all line items for which reimbursement is requested to verify cost eligibility and consistency with the line items in the Development Budget. The third-party reviewer may conduct construction inspections on behalf of Commerce to verify progress and compliance with plans and specifications.

## 403.6. Project Documentation

The contractor and developer are responsible for knowing the documentation requirements contained in the HTF contract and explained in this handbook. Required documents must be submitted to the HTF Project Manager to be maintained in the project file. All required documents must be in the project file at the completion of development.

Once construction is at least fifty percent (50%) complete, the HTF Project Manager will send the contractor a checklist of all final and outstanding documents and provide a timeframe for submitting them. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Certificate of Occupancy (or Substantial Completion), as applicable
- Final Development Budget and Operating Pro Forma
- Operating and Reserve Account Statements
- Tenant Selection Plan
- As-Built Capital Needs Assessment
- Management Plan
- ESDS Orientation, Owners, and Residents Manual
- Property and Liability Insurance Certificates

In addition, projects serving persons with developmental disabilities must have a referral agreement between the contractor and the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). A copy of this agreement must be provided to Commerce when the project is placed in service.

## 403.6.1. Required Elements of the Management Plan

The contractor shall submit a Management Plan that includes the following:

1. General Description;
2. Performance Standards;
3. Accounting System;
4. Marketing Procedures;
5. Leasing Procedures:
6. Rent-Setting Procedures;
7. Special Needs Services, as applicable;
8. Maintenance Schedule;
9. Security Plan; and

## 403.6.1(b). Accounting System

- How is project income handled?
- How are funds disbursed from the project?
- What policies are in place for establishing deposit amounts for both operating and replacements reserves?

Note: If only one person is involved, risk is high. The person who balances the checkbook should not be the same person who writes the checks, or there should be monthly oversight by management of account balances.

## 403.6.1(c). Marketing Procedures

- Is there a waiting list? How is the list managed?
- Are there types of households that receive special attention, or which have priority on the waiting list?
- When and how is the waiting list refreshed?

## 403.6.1(f). Special Needs Services

- If the project serves a special needs population, who is the service provider?
- When and how is the service provider evaluated?
- How are complaints handled regarding special needs services?

Note: Copies of service and referral agreements with provider agencies (if applicable) need to be provided to Commerce for review/approval.

## 403.6.1(g). Maintenance Schedule

- When and how often are units inspected?
- What is the schedule for routine maintenance of all building and property systems?
- How are reports by residents of building or system malfunctions handled?
- What is the time frame sought for resolution of those concerns?

## 403.6.1(h). Security and Emergency Plan

- How are additional  green  activities,  such  as  recycling,  gardening  and  use  of  healthy  cleaning materials, encouraged?

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Are there procedures for documenting that each new resident is provided a walk-through and orientation that reviews the building's green features, operations and maintenance?

## 403.6.2. Submission of the Management Plan

The Management Plan must be provided electronically to the HTF Project Manager at least four (4) months prior to occupancy. Commerce may require that additional information be included in the Management Plan such as those provided in the Management Plan Checklist. Contractors may use the checklist to complete the Management Plan, which should include the required information and a table of contents. Commerce may provide contractors with an optional Management Plan template, upon request.

Commerce will have up to 60 days from receipt of the Management Plan to review and provide feedback. Contractor must update its Management Plan to add missing requirements as needed and return to Commerce for review within 30 days. This process may be repeated until all requirements are included in the Management Plan and Commerce has approved.

Management Plans are to be reviewed regularly, and updates are to be provided to Commerce.

Note: Organizations are evaluated on their performance regarding timely submission of documents.

## Section 404. Award Revisions

In certain circumstances, award revisions may be allowed once an award has been made but has not yet been contracted. Award revisions may be considered only for changes in deal structure, overall concept, site issues, construction review changes or other substantial changes that are caused by circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.

The process for an award revision consideration is as follows:

- Applicant will submit documentation of changes, including, but not limited to updated development budget, operating pro-forma, and development schedule, as well as an explanation of the circumstances that occurred that are beyond the control of the applicant causing the need for proposed changes. This information may closely follow an amendment application (provided by Commerce staff upon request) or be prescribed by the HTF Project Manager.
- HTF Management will present recommendations to the Assistant Director for the Housing Division for consideration.

This process is limited to the time period after an award has been made and prior to contract execution. If the contract has not been executed within the negotiated timeframe, this process may be used to determine if the award commitment should be extended or terminated. If the award is rescinded, the contractor may need to reapply for funding.

Monetary award revisions must follow the procedures as set forth in Section 405.2. Monetary Amendments.

## Section 405. Contract Amendments

Amendments are required to make changes to executed contracts and are intended to address urgent needs. Increasing or decreasing an award before there is an executed contract does not require an amendment, but a revision to the award (see Section 404. Award Revisions above). Contract amendments must be executed to be validate changes, and amendments or restatements of other legal documents are also sometimes necessary. Refer to Section 504. Contract Amendments During Commitment Period for amendments that are needed after a project is placed in service.

## 405.1. Technical Amendments

Technical amendments are reviewed and acted upon on a case-by-case basis. They include, but are not limited to, an extension of the contract completion date, revisions to the loan terms and conditions, reallocation of HTF funding to replacement reserves and revisions to the target population(s).

- Contractors must submit amendment requests in writing to the HTF Project Manager.
- The request must describe the proposed changes in detail and provide justification for these changes.
- The HTF Project Manager and HTF Management will review the request and make a recommendation to the Assistant Director who will approve or deny the amendment request.

## 405.2. Monetary Amendments

Monetary amendments involve a change in the funding provided to a project by Commerce. If a project develops a funding gap amount, prompt, regular communication with the HTF Project Manager is critical.

- All requests for monetary amendments must be submitted through the HTF Project Manager.
- When several awarded projects are encountering delays, and funding is available, Commerce will solicit information from projects of a certain age, project type or fund source. These comparisons will be done in a consistent manner at a time deliberately set by Commerce, not in response to individual project requests. Funding gaps must be substantiated, and requests submitted in a form prescribed by Commerce.
- The  review  will  include  whether  the  costs  were  unforeseeable,  the  awardee's  pursuit  of alternative options and the assessment of other public funders.
- Only projects that have been awarded as a result of a competitive round will be considered eligible for gap funding. Projects that received direct appropriations of funding via the Capital Budget, and which have remaining budget shortfalls, must apply through a competitive HTF funding round to be considered for additional funding.
- An increase to the developer fee is not allowed.

If additional funds are not awarded and the project cannot proceed, Awardees may deem it necessary to surrender or return the original award, and/or and reapply in a subsequent funding round.

## Section 406. Placed In Service

The purpose of this section is to outline what occurs once a project is 'Placed in Service'. A project is considered to be placed in service once a certificate of occupancy, or its equivalent as defined in the

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Glossary, has been issued for the property. The Placed in Service date is used to determine the start of the commitment/affordability period, annual reporting, and compliance monitoring.

## 406.1. File Review

Once the Scope of Work outlined in Attachment B of the HTF contract have been completed, the HTF Project Manager will initiate a Placed in Service file review to ensure that all legal documentation has been received and that all necessary fiscal, administrative, and programmatic management documents are in place. Projects that have not submitt ed all of the required 'Placed In Service' documents to Commerce within one year of the activity completion date, as referenced in the development schedule, will be considered out of compliance and may move to 'workout' status (refer to Section 504. Contract Amendments during Commitment Period).

## 406.2. Initiation of Compliance

When a project is placed in service, the HTF Asset Management and Compliance Team assumes monitoring responsibilities for the duration of the contract commitment period. Compliance Asset Management staff will contact the contractor to initiate asset management activities, including setup in the Web-Based Annual Reporting System (WBARS).

Refer to Chapter 5. Compliance and Asset Management for additional information on HTF guidelines and procedures for compliance and asset management.

## 406.3. Placed in Service Site Visit

Within 12 months of project completion, an HTF Compliance Asset Manager will schedule a Placed in Service site visit to meet with property management staff. All applicable files must be made available upon request to Commerce staff for review during the site visit. However, the primary purpose of this initial visit is to discuss Commerce's expectations and provide technical assistance. The Compliance Asset Manager will notify the contractor in writing of any issues or concerns identified during the site visit and recommended course of action.

## Section 407. Third-Party Certification of Final Project Costs

The certification of final project/development costs became a new HTF requirement in 2019 (RCW 43.185A.190). It is anticipated that changes may be needed from time to time to accommodate all project types and situations and correct any unintended consequences. Commerce reserves the right to modify the guidelines in this section, as needed, to meet its legislative and policy requirements, and will notify contractors of any such changes in writing.

All Commerce funding sources, except for preservation awards, must provide certified final development cost reports to Commerce in a form acceptable to Commerce.

Certified project final development costs are due to Commerce no more than 90 days from the time the project is placed in service, in a format required by Commerce. If project is also financed by Commission, the 90-day requirement may be extended if the reason for delay is to comply with procedures or requirements of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.

## 407.1 Requirements for Projects Funded in 2019 and in the Future

All affordable housing projects funded by Commerce, including directly appropriated projects and HOME and National HTF project s, will be required to submit a ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' worksheet to Commerce when they are placed in service. The submission must be accompanied by a certification from a third-party Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the form of an audit. This applies to both LIHTC and non-LIHTC projects, as described further below.

The ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' worksheet will be posted on HTF's website (www.commerce.wa.gov/htf). It is a modified version of Form 6A, which is familiar to the HTF and LIHTC contractors. Form 6A is used to submit a new development budget via the Combined Funders Application, as well as to update budgets prior to contract closeout and after the project is placed in service.

NOTE: The cost to obtain a thirdparty certification of a project's final development costs is a reimbursable expense under HTF's current policies (see Section 202.5. Eligible/Ineligible Costs). Current contractors and new applicants are highly encouraged to track these costs separately in their development budgets. Form 6A includes a new line item for the cost of the third-party certification.

## 407.1.1. LIHTC Projects

Projects utilizing LIHTC must instruct their cost certification CPA to attach the ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' worksheet to the project's LIHTC cost certification in order to meet the HTF -specific requirements. The CPA will need to provide their opinion on the LIHTC and HTF information and submit their cost certification packet concurrently to both Commerce and the Commission.

## 407.1.2. Non-LIHTC Projects

Projects not utilizing LIHTC -both multifamily/rental and homeownership -shall obtain the third-party certification of their project final development costs in the form of a project audit. HTF contractors must instruct their CPA to submit the audited ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs' worksheet directly to Commerce no more than 90 days after the project is placed in service. Pursuant to Section 406 above, 'A project is considered to be placed in service once a certificate of occupancy, or equivalent, ha s been issued for the property .'

The cost of the audit is dependent on the CPA's level of engagement needed for the CPA to review internal controls of the organization. For example, the level of audit review might be less comprehensive and less costly if the CPA is already familiar with and convinced that the organization's internal controls are strong.

To save costs, HTF contractors have the option to obtain the third-party certification of their project final development costs as part of their organization's annual audit. If this option is selected, the certification of the project costs must be submitted to Commerce no later than 90 days from the end of the organization's fiscal year that is being audited . For example, if the organization's fiscal year ends on December 31, the HTF cost certification is due to Commerce no later than March 30.

## Homeownership Projects

All homeownership projects involving construction or acquisition/rehabilitation are required to submit their certified final development costs once all HTF funds have been drawn down and all contracted units/homes are placed in service. The only projects excluded from the certification requirement are

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook down payment assistance, where HTF funds are being exclusively used at the closing table to buy-down the cost of a pre-existing home by being paid directly to the seller, and where there is no construction or remodeling of any sort (e.g., the home is in ' turnkey ' condition). However, the down payment assistance projects will continue to submit to HTF the total purchase price of the home via a final settlement statement and a copy of the property purchase and sale agreement to substantiate the final total cost of each property (which are required when HTF funds are drawn down).

Use of proceeds from a Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) to assist new homeowners will not be required to submit a third-party cost certification. However, RLF uses will continue to be reported annually to HTF throughout the contract's commitment period.

## Scattered Site Projects (Rental and Homeownership)

All rental and homeownership scattered site projects are required to submit their certified final development costs no more than 90 days after all contracted units/properties are placed in service. The costs for each site must be entered on the respective tab within the ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' workbook, which includes tabs for each site. The ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' worksheet includes formulas that will automatically aggregate the total project costs entered on the individual site tabs. Please note that only the ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' worksheet (which reports the total aggregate project costs) requires third-party certification. Certification is not required at each site level; however, the CPA may choose to review those costs as well.

## 407.2. Requirements for Projects Funded Prior to 2019

Projects funded prior to the release of the 2019-21 Capital Budget will continue to provide their final development costs to Commerce using Form 6A. Some of these projects also use LITHC, in which case they will also submit (or have submitted) a certified cost report to the Commission. The Commission will share these cost certifications with Commerce.

## 407.3. Completing and Submitting Certified Development Costs

For multiple-site projects, data will need to be provided for each site in ' HTF Certified Final Development Costs ' worksheet (found at www.commerce.wa.gov/htf). If the project has more than 15 sites, contact the HTF Project Manager for assistance.

Once the Excel file has been completed, the HTF contractor shall request the CPA to perform the certification of their project's final development costs, as described above. The CPA must submit their complete cost certifications to Commerce directly to HTFCompliance@commerce.wa.gov.

The HTF contractors must also send the completed Excel file of HTF Final Certified Costs workbook (including all applicable tabs) to Commerce, which can be separately emailed to HTFCompliance@commerce.wa.gov. This will greatly assist HTF staff with data entry, analyzing, and producing reports as needed.

## CHAPTER 5: COMPLIANCE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT

## Section 500. Purpose

All real estate finance portfolios must be actively managed to protect their root source of capital and to ensure that the investments made with that capital are advancing the intended purposes. The Housing Trust Fund portfolio is no exception.

Housing Trust Fund money is specifically mandated to assist low and very low-income citizens meet their basic housing needs. Therefore, care is taken to invest Housing Trust Fund dollars in projects that serve households with low incomes, often with special needs, and provide appropriate and well-maintained housing for many years.

The Housing Trust Fund's Portfolio Management Team is responsible for oversight and monitoring all affordable housing projects that have been placed in service, regardless of their funding mechanism (competitively awarded or directly appropriated). Monitoring consists of desk monitoring, on-site visits, and contract management that help inform stakeholders as to whether or not the invested dollars are yielding what is expected. Monitoring activities may involve coordination with other public funders. This coordination could include sharing annual report information and on-site monitoring duties and reports.

The goal of the Portfolio Management Team is to ensure that projects are providing safe and affordable housing to Washington State's vulnerable persons for the full commitment period required in the legal documents. The nature of these projects requires a strong and positive relationship between the State and contractors. Department of Commerce (Commerce) aims to prevent potential compliance issues by working proactively with organizations to address changing conditions. HTF staff provide technical assistance where appropriate to ensure the long-term viability of Housing Trust Fund projects.

Housing Trust Fund staff responsibilities during the term of a contract include:

- Monitoring project performance.
- Providing technical assistance and training.
- Working with contractors to adjust to changing conditions.
- Enforcing terms of written agreements, up to and including all avenues of recourse.

Contractor responsibilities during the term of a contract include:

- Providing a timely and complete annual report for every project that is placed in service.
- Providing yearly audits and certificates of proof of insurance.
- Making payments per contract terms.
- Communicating with Asset Management staff about any changes that may impact the original agreement and/or ability to continue to provide affordable housing as outlined in the contract.
- Cooperating with on-site monitoring.
- Participating in an amendment request or technical assistance strategies.
- Maintaining the property in a decent, safe, sanitary condition, and in good repair.

## Section 501. Monitoring

Department of Commerce has a statutory responsibility to monitor HTF recipients for compliance. As stated in RCW 43.185A.070 : 'The director shall monitor the activities of recipients of grants and loans

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook under this chapter to determine compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in its application or stated by the department in connection with the grant or loan.'

## 501.1. Project Annual Report Review

Desk monitoring primarily consists of reviewing annual reports, examining audited financial information, and tracking loan repayments. Timely, complete, and accurate annual reports, organizational financial audits, and certificates of proof of insurance are the primary documents used by asset managers to determine compliance. Loan payment history is also monitored and incorporated into the overall assessment of contract compliance.

Refer to Section 501.3. Annual Reports, Section 507. Audit and Insurance Requirements, and Section 501.2. Loan Payments.

## 501.1.1. HTF Income Requirements

HTF contractors must verify that each household occupying an HTF-assisted unit is income-eligible by determining the household's annual income prior to occupancy through the certification process. Thereafter, the contractors must recertify the tenant 's household income for every year of occupancy during the HTF contract commitment period.

When determining eligibility, the contractor must use the HUD's definition of ' annual income" as defined in 24 CFR 5.609. If the contract requires so, the contractor should use the adjusted gross income as defined in the HTF contract. Only one definition can be applied to each HTF-assisted property.

The initial certification and first annual recertification of a particular household requires third-party verification of all income and qualified assets. Annual self-certifications are acceptable every year thereafter with the exception of every sixth year of the household's occupancy, when third -party verification is required.

Detailed guidelines for income-certification are included in Appendix B. Household Income Calculations. [Federal reform coming through the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act (HOTMA) will be assessed and implemented by Commerce in due time.]

## Housing of Students

Commerce's position on students housed within HTF -funded properties follows HUD's Section 8 Student Rule as outlined in the Federal Register Notice dated September 21, 2016 (Docket No. FR-5969-N-01). Student Status Forms can be found on Commerce ' HOME Program website under Forms and documents: HTF/HOME/NHTF Student Status Form.

## 501.1.2. HTF Rent Limits

Commerce uses the Section 8 rent limits as a baseline in the calculation of maximum rents used on housing units funded by the HTF. T he rent limits are derived from HUD's Section 8 income limits ; however, for the 30% limits, Commerce uses the limits without the increases for poverty guidelines in the Section 8 Extremely Low Family Inocmes.; therefore, the limits do not align with the published HUD Section 8 limits. Maximum rents to be paid by the tenant are determined by the AMI of the target population and the number of bedrooms in each unit.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Commerce applies the HTF rent limits to the sum of the resident rent payment plus utility allowance. Thus, for HTF-funded units, the maximum rent that can be charged to tenants is equal to the -HTF rent limit less the allowance for resident-paid utilities (excluding telephone, cable television, and other telecommunications). Commerce publishes rent and income limits annually, refer to Commerce published rent limits which can be found on Commerce's HOME webpage under Forms and documents and at: HTF/HOME/NHTF Rent &amp; Income Limits

The intent is for the tenant share of rent on HTF-funded units not to exceed 30 percent of the monthly income of the target AMI population.

## Rental Subsidies

Project Based Subsidy: HTF does not apply the Section 8 rent limits to gross rent for tenants who are receiving subsidy through a Project Based Contract as long as the tenant's share of rent does not exceed 30% of the household's income .

Tenant Based Subsidy: HTF allows for the resident's share of the rent plus subsidy to exceed the Section 8 rent limit, as long as the resident's portion does not exceed the maximum allowed rent less utility allowance for the AMI target population. If a tenant based subsidized household is occupying a unit that is at a lower AMI than that of a nonsubsidized household and the contract allows, HTF recommends that the AMI is swapped between the two units.

For example, the tenant-based household is occupying unit A-1 and a non-tenant-based household is occupying unit B-1. Unit A-1 is restricted at 30% AMI and Unit B-1 is restricted at 50% AMI. Once the income of the household occupying unit A-1 increases above 30%, HTF recommends that the unit restrictions are swapped. Unit A-1 is now restricted at 50% AMI and Unit B-1 is restricted at 30%.

## Multiple Public Funding Sources

For projects with multiple public funding sources, the most restrictive limits apply. The Multifamily Tax Subsidy Projects (MTSP) and the Housing Economic Recovery Act (HERA) income and rent limits do not apply to HTF contracts. Contractors should become familiar with the contractual requirements of each funder and apply the most restrictive rent limits.

## 501.1.3. Rent Overcharges

HTF contractors are responsible to apply the current and most restrictive rent limits to HTF-funded housing units.

If Commerce identifies a potential rent overcharge via the annual report review, the contractor must investigate the issue and provide a written response. Upon confirmation of a rent overcharge, the contractor must refund the affected tenant the amount of overpayment and document resolution of the issue within 30 days of Commerce's review.

If the contractor self-identifies a rent overcharge, it must refund the tenant within 30 days of discovery and notify Commerce concerning identification and resolution of the issue.

Regarding rent overcharges to former tenants, the contractor shall make reasonable efforts to locate the previous tenants and refund overpayments within 60 days of identifying the issue. Within the same timeframe, the contractor shall inform Commerce in writing of the steps taken to find and refund the former tenants and the outcome of these efforts.

## 501.2. Loan Payments

Asset Management staff tracks the status of loan payments. Contractors must contact AM staff at MHULoanServicing@commerce.wa.gov if they cannot make their payments or will be late making payments. If a contractor is pursuing an amendment to their contract , AM may agree, at Commerce's discretion, to suspend loan payments during the amendment process.

Contractors that fail to make their payments and do not contact HTF Asset Management staff regarding the situation are considered to be out of compliance with the HTF loan terms. For information on addressing compliance issues, refer to Section 505. Addressing Compliance Issues.

## 501.3. Annual Reports

Annual reporting is a requirement of the Housing Trust Fund contract. The Combined Funders' WebBased Annual Reporting System (WBARS) is used by contractors to submit annual reports, and is the primary tool used by Commerce to monitor contract compliance and project performance for the Housing Trust Fund's portfolio of projects. WBARS was created to meet the needs of multiple pu blic funders.

The annual reporting period is a calendar year beginning January 1 and ending December 31. There are five report tables. Commerce requires that Tables 1, 2 and 3 be submitted to the Funder level by January 31 of the year following the end of the reporting period. Table 4 must be submitted to the Funder level by June 30. Backup documentation is also required by June 30. Refer to the Matrix of Supplemental Annual Report Materials, available on the Compliance Reporting webpage.

Failure to submit timely, complete and accurate annual reports may result in the contractor being considered out of compliance with the terms and conditions of their contract. Contractors may be asked to re-submit reports which are incomplete or contain erroneous data. Failure to correct and re-submit an annual report when required can also place the contractor out of compliance.

Note: Delinquent reports can affect consideration in future HTF funding rounds, as well as result in withholding of reimbursement from the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Fund Program or other HTF funding for the organization.

## 501.3.1. Annual Report Assessment Criteria

Asset and Compliance Managers review annual reports for contract compliance and project performance. Key elements of this review include:

## Compliance:

- Are the required number of units being made available to low-income households?
- Do tenants meet area median income (AMI) requirements?
- Are rent limits on income-restricted units being observed?
- Are the required target populations being served?
- Are unit vacancy periods brief?

## Performance:

- Is the occupancy rate high?
- Is the Debt Coverage Ratio adequate?
- Is the operating reserve sufficient?
- Are there adequate annual deposits to the Replacement and Operating Reserves?

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Is cash flow positive?

Note: Contractors are encouraged to add comments to their reports explaining any unusual circumstances affecting project performance. Adequate explanations often reduce the necessity for follow-up.

## 501.3.2. Annual Report Reviews

Annual reports will be reviewed by Commerce staff using the assessment criteria above. Potential contract compliance issues and performance concerns may be identified during the annual report review. Projects will be evaluated as follows:

In Compliance: Projects with annual report submissions that do not require additional inquiry will receive notification that no contract compliance or performance issues were identified.

Projects demonstrating potential contract compliance and/or performance concerns will receive a letter outlining the areas of concern.

Compliance Concerns: Projects identified as being potentially out of compliance with the terms of the HTF contract are required to provide a written response within 30 days of receipt of the annual report review. Potential contract compliance issues are:

- Unmet unit set-aside requirements
- Questionable tenant eligibility
- Rent overcharges to tenants occupying restricted units
- Extended unit vacancies

Performance Concerns: Projects without potential contract compliance issues but displaying one or more of the following performance concerns are required to provide a written response:

- Low occupancy rate
- Inadequate debt coverage
- Negative cash flow
- Insufficient Operating Reserves and annual deposits
- Insufficient Replacement Reserve and annual deposits

## 501.3.3. Reserve Account Performance Criteria

Commerce requires contractors to establish and maintain Separate Reserve Accounts. One Replacement and One Operating for all HTF Projects/Sites and should have separate ledgers for each showing debits and Credits.

The general requirements and limits on Replacement and Operating reserves may be adjusted periodically based on public funder standards. Commerce may also adjust the requirements for specific projects based on a review of the capital needs and operating risks of the particular project. A project showing positive net operating income in its operating budget may be required to make additional contributions to its Operating and Replacement reserves.

- Replacement Reserves. The Replacement Reserves consists of funds set aside for the replacement of, or major repair work on, the component systems of a housing facility. The amounts deposited in the Replacement Reserves account should be based on a capital needs

assessment, to include an analysis of all facility systems that will wear out over the life of the project, and the estimated costs to repair and replace those systems. Funds from the reserve may only be used for capital assets that have a useful life exceeding one year. This includes but is not limited to major repairs to or replacement of appliances and major fixtures, windows and doors, plumbing and heating systems, and re-roofing. Short-term maintenance costs for items with a useful life of less than one year should be paid for with project cash flow or organizational sources.

- Operating Reserves. The Operating Reserves consists of funds budgeted each year to cover unforeseen operating costs. The Operating Reserves may also be used to pay for work that cannot be entirely funded by the Replacement Reserves. The reserve amount should normally be equivalent to 6 months of all expenses incurred during the first year of operations, excluding long-term Replacement Reserve items.

## 501.4. On-site Monitoring

On-site monitoring is a critical aspect of asset management and is an important part of ensuring that projects are well managed. This activity is conducted by the Compliance Asset Manager (CAM). The purpose of on-site monitoring is to assess compliance with the HTF contract and adequate performance related to property management, file management and maintenance of the physical property. All public funders conduct some level of on-site monitoring. To most efficiently use public resources and reduce redundancies, on-site monitoring responsibilities may be coordinated with other public funders when possible.

A Placed in S ervice visit will occur within 12 months of a project's placed in service date (i.e., the date of the Certificate of Occupancy). The purpose of this visit is to facilitate relationship building and ensure that the project is off to a good start. During the visit, the Compliance Asset Manager will assess property management and maintenance practices. The CAM will review a sample of resident files and conduct a physical inspection of no less than 20% of the total units at the property to include a walkthrough of buildings, common areas, and the site. After the Placed in Service visit, on-site monitoring visits will normally occur once every three years. The regular on-site monitoring visit includes the same components as the Placed in Service visit.

- Is the property being maintained in a decent, safe, sanitary manner and is in good repair?

Commerce may schedule more or less frequent monitoring visits depending on the assessed risk of a particular property to the Housing Trust Fund portfolio.

Refer to Section 502. Monitoring Home General Purpose Funded Projects for specific guidance and additional requirements for projects with HOME funding.

## 501.4.1. Scheduling and Notice

On-site monitoring visits will be scheduled a minimum of 14 days in advance. Once a monitoring visit has been scheduled, a confirmation notice of the visit will be emailed to the organization. Organizations can request to reschedule if they have a conflict with the proposed visit date. Due to the overwhelming volume of projects needing on-site inspection, organizations are encouraged to be flexible in the scheduling of these visits. Organizations are expected to have appropriate personnel present during the on-site visit who can answer questions regarding management and maintenance policies and practices. Organizations must provide 48-hour written notice to all tenants prior to a site visit.

## 501.4.2. On-Site Document Monitoring

During the site visit, the Compliance Asset Manager will review policies, procedures and other documents used to manage the property. This may include the management plan, maintenance schedules and checklist, resident selection polices, waiting lists, rent rolls, capital needs assessment (CNA), third-party agreements, lease documents, compliance with landlord-tenant laws, and other items deemed necessary by the inspector. The resident file review and verification will include a sampling of resident files to verify completion of income certifications and to compare information in the files with annual reports submitted to Commerce via the WBARS.

Records, including all active and inactive resident files, are required to be retained for six (6) years beyond the end of the HTF Contract commitment period or last audit; whichever is later. Some contracts may contain different language. If this is the case, the contract requirements must be followed.

## 501.4.3. On-Site Physical Inspection

During the site visit, the Compliance Asset Manager will conduct a physical inspection of the property that includes all aspects of the property, i.e. site, buildings, systems, common areas and randomly selected units. Inspection of property and units will be conducted in accordance with the standards that meets the expectations for maintaining a decent, safe and sanitary property while ensuring the long viability of the asset as determined by Commerce. At minimum 20 percent of the units will be inspected including accessible units. Vacant units will need to be accessible for inspection. Additional units may be inspected if deemed necessary by the inspector.

## 501.4.4. Exit Report and Follow-up

Within 7 days of the on-site monitoring visit, the Compliance Asset Manager will provide the contractor with a follow-up exit report detailing any discrepancies, findings, concerns, and actions required. The exit report will contain specific expectations for documenting completion of required actions and a deadline for returning the exit report response to the inspector. Organizations will be responsible for correcting all discrepancies and findings or submitting a corrective action plan by the deadline, which is typically 30 days from the date of the exit report was sent.

The Compliance Asset Manager (CAM) will review the exit report response to determine if it meets contract compliance and project performance expectations.

- If the contractor's response does not meet expectations, the CAM will follow up with a request for additional information that includes an explanation as to why the original response was not accepted.
- Once a satisfactory response is received from the contractor, the CAM will send written communication to inform the organization that on-site monitoring for that year is concluded.

The exit report may also include recommendations and other technical assistance. Recommendations do not require additional action by the organization. However, if the information will benefit the project's long-term operational viability, Commerce expects that organizations will adopt and act on recommendations.

## 501.5. Homeownership

See Chapter 6. Homeownership Program.

## 501.6. Organizational Assessments

Organization Assessments are typically performed as part of the competitive application review process but may also be done any time it appears that an organization is at risk. For example, asset management staff may wish to complete an assessment to measure risk as part of an amendment or project restructure review. The Organization Assessment consists of an in-depth review of:

- Prior annual reports;
- Recent organization audits;
- Borrower history with the Housing Trust Fund; and
- Property management of the projects within the HTF Portfolio.

Organizations with projects, which have received HTF funding, may undergo this type of assessment to examine the organization's capacity to provide quality affordable housing long -term.

Organizations with many HTFfunded projects can represent a significant risk to the State's portfolio. Thus, every effort will be made to support their continued ability to provide housing. Technical assistance will be provided to help organizations understand their projects from a portfolio management standpoint and to advance their understanding of quality management practices and important market conditions. HTF staff will also work with other public funders to support training opportunities related to asset and property management best practices.

## Section 502. Monitoring HOME General Purpose Funded Projects

Information about the HOME and National HTF programs can be located on Commerce's website. Program guidelines and rental management handbooks are available under Handbooks.

When the HOME Program or NHTF Affordability Period expires, the project will be subject to general HTF program requirements for the remainder of the contract commitment period. Commerce will send a close-out letter to the contractor with further information.

## Section 503. Technical Assistance

Portfolio Management has the capability to provide a wide range of technical assistance and possible referral for third-party assistance. We are particularly adept at providing guidance regarding Housing Trust Fund, HOME, and NHTF Program s' contractual obligations and performance expectations for affordable housing. Technical assistance is typically provided during on-site inspections, in exit reports following on-site inspections, and via annual report reviews; however, Commerce can arrange for additional assistance outside of these interactions. Commerce also maintains a Compliance and Reporting webpage.

The intention of technical assistance is to improve project viability and sustainability. Contractors should contact the Compliance Supervisor for next steps in receiving assistance.

Contractors can request technical assistance and/or trainings via email at the following addresses and your request will be routed to the appropriate team member: HTFcompliance@commerce.wa.gov or HTFportfoliomgmt@commerce.wa.gov

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Commerce staff also provides technical assistance using the Combined Funders' WBARS. Refer to the Housing Trust Fund Compliance and Reporting webpage for contact information.

For complete instructions and additional information regarding WBARS, please consult the WBARS User Guide v2. Training seminars are offered by the public funders participating in WBARS. For additional information, instructions and WBARS training information, refer to the Washington State Housing Finance Commission's WBARS webpage.

## Section 504. Contract Amendments During Commitment Period

It is Asset Management's goal to ensure long-term project viability such that the intended population continues to be served. When a contractor faces challenges in meeting the contract terms, an amendment of the contract terms may be considered. The Asset Management (AM) team consider a contractor's proposed solutions to address problems arising with Housing Trust Fund projects after being placed in service. When this occurs, the contractor should contact Asset Management as early as possible to discuss. A contractor may submit, or Asset Management staff may recommend submission of, an application for a contract amendment.

It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit a formal application for a contract amendment including the application form and all checklist documentation. These application forms can be requested by email to HTFportfoliomgmt@commerce.wa.gov.

Upon request, the Asset Management team will send an application and schedule an initial consultation to assess the situation and answer any questions about the application process. Once the application is received by Commerce, timelines and documentation requests will depend on project complexity, but contractors can typically expect to receive a response from the Asset Manager within two weeks of submitting an application.

Contractors must allow for at least 90 days to review an application and render a decision (these can be longer depending on the complexity of the situation). If a modification is approved, Commerce needs at least 30 days to amend the legal documents. Amendment requests are prioritized based on critical timing, risk assessment, and other public funders' involvement.

Asset Management reserves the right to deny any request. If the request is denied, the Asset Manager will provide the contractor with the justification for the denial. If a contractor fails to participate in the workout process by not responding to Asset Management communications or by not providing necessary documentation, Asset Management staff will assess the project's risk to the portfolio and may halt the workout process or pursue more serious actions.

Below are common workout categories with definitions and criteria to be used as guidelines. Commerce takes the requests seriously and strives to ensure that any amendment serves the greater public interest in affordable housing while managing high quality housing for residents.

## 504.1. Scope of Work Changes

This category represents changes in a project's original scope of work that typically do not change the loan terms or underlying security documents.

Examples may include but are not limited to:

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Small changes in the number of restricted units, to include creation of common areas, resident manager apartment, etc.
- Minor changes in target population, i.e., population type or median income.
- Corrections to errors in the contract i.e. inconsistency in number of units required.
- Easements include, but not limited to, cell towers, billboards, and temporary construction (see Section 504.7.2. for Partial Sales or Conveyances, if applicable).

The Asset Manager will review the request to determine if the proposed changes meet HTF eligibility requirements.

Criteria include but are not limited to:

- Property cannot secure qualified tenants.
- Original program model is no longer viable.
- There is a loss of funding sources for operations and/or services.

## 504.2. Year 15 Expiring Tax Credit Projects

Contractors with tax credit projects nearing the end of their 15-year tax credit compliance period should contact the Housing Trust Fund's Asset Management team as they begin planning the project's exit strategy. Once the exit strategy is finalized, the contractor or its representative must submit a letter, in some cases in addition to an application to Asset Management outlining the exit tax liability and the new ownership structure. Commerce's consent and approval of the final plan will be required. In so me cases, it may be necessary to amend HTF legal documents to reflect the new ownership structure.

These commonly are either:

- Tax Credit Investor Exit Notification: When the LIHTC Investor Member is exiting the organization, and the entity remains intact. In this scenario the Original Contractor will assume ownership of the investor interest. No other changes are involved. For these, there is an abbreviated process.
- Tax Credit Investor Exit with Assignment: When there is a transfer of ownership to the General Partner or Managing Member or a related entity who will continue to operate the Project following the end of the LIHTC Compliance period: Transfer involves no or limited consideration beyond the assumption of debts, limited or no exit taxes, retention of reserves, and continued affordability. Commerce will need more documentation than above.

If none of the original partners/members will be part of the new ownership entity, refer to Section 504.7. Sale of Property.

## 504.3. Refinancing and Subordination

Contractors may request Commerce to subordinate its Deed of Trust to private or public senior debt that is secured by the property. Commerce will need to review and approve other lenders' loan documents and subordination agreements prior to refinancing. Such approval shall be at Commerce's sole discretion (see Section 204.9. Subordination).

If Commerce's contract documents need to be amended and/or Commerce's deed is expected to take a subordinate role as a result of the refinance, Commerce will require that cash proceeds/net proceed from refinances be used for improvements/repairs to the property, replenishing the property's Capital

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Reserves, and/or improvements/repairs to other HTFfinanced properties in the contractor's portfolio, all of which will need Commerce's review and approval prior to amending any legal documents.

Refinancing should not be the sole mechanism by which capital improvements are accomplished. Projects are expected to maintain sufficient replacement reserves based on a capital needs assessment and a life cycle cost analysis of building systems.

Circumstances for refinancing may include, but are not limited to:

- Market conditions or loan pay-down may have increased the equity that could be captured and put to use on the property.
- The project may need repairs or rehabilitation.
- The contractor may get a better interest rate.
- The contractor may want to pay down or pay off other loans on the project including Commerce's loan.

Contractors will need to submit a written request documenting their proposed plan and how it will enhance the project, the organization, and provide public benefit.

Criteria for Commerce 's approval may include, but are not limited to:

- Improvements are made to the property through repair, rehabilitation, or other capital improvements.
- Improvements are made to the debt coverage and/or the cash flow of the project.
- The state's lien position is improved.
- The state's loan is reduced or paid off.
- Additional public benefit is achieved.
- Risk to the state's original investment is reduced.

For more subordination criteria, see also Section 204.9. Subordination.

## 504.4 LIHTC Syndications or Resyndications

Contractors with existing HTF Projects that are considering LIHTC Programs as a funding mechanism for their Project(s) must reach out to Asset Management 6 months prior to any anticipated changes to existing ownership structures and before the creation of new ownership entities. Early communication will allow for Asset Management to collaborate with the Contractor in developing a plan for managing the transition of the existing HTF Contract.

## 504.5. Loan Restructure

Under rare circumstances, Commerce may consider a change in loan terms to reduce a project's financial burden.

Circumstances that may be considered, include but are not limited to:

- Substantial change in market conditions from what was originally forecasted.
- Approved changes in target population.
- Decrease in available subsidies that are not attributable to the contractor.
- Higher than expected vacancy rates, turnover costs, or unanticipated expenses related to natural disasters not covered by insurance.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Organizations must prove financial hardship related to current loan terms.

Criteria may include but are not limited to:

- Project does not generate sufficient income or cash flow to cover expenses, debt service, and/or health and safety related capital improvements.
- Project is unable to meet loan terms in either the short- or long-term.

Commerce does not change loans to grants. In the event of a payment deferral request, Commerce can agree to extend contract end of term date in order to forego payment.

Commerce will undergo more extensive End of Contract policy formation to provide greater predictability and efficiency as the portfolio ages.

## 504.6. Transfer of Ownership

Under certain circumstances , and only with Commerce's explicit approval, a property may be transferred to another HTF eligible organization. (Refer to Section 202. Eligibility Guidelines.) A transfer is defined as the assumption of underlying HTF contract, legal documents, and debt. Where/if any sale or transfer cash proceeds/net proceeds are realized by the current owner, please refer to Section 504.7. Sale of Property. New owners will be required to comply with the existing specific contractual obligations.

Circumstances that will be considered include, but are not limited to:

- Current owner can no longer provide housing.
- Community needs have changed, and the new population does not fit the organization's mission.
- Market conditions have changed.
- Property cannot secure qualified tenants under the current ownership.
- Subsidies are no longer available.

HTF Asset Management will review any request for property transfer to an eligible organization, which may be recommended by the current contractor or HTF Asset Management. If a transfer will affect tenant occupancy, prior to tenant relocation, the current owner must reach out to Commerce and complete an Amendment Application. See Section 203.3. Tenant Relocation for more details.

Criteria for the proposed new owner may include but are not limited to:

- Eligible organization.
- Engaged in an eligible activity.
- Fiscally sound and experienced in managing affordable housing.
- Staff possesses the skills and experience serving the existing tenant population.

When a transfer occurs, current project Reserves must transfer with the property.

## 504.7. Sale of Property

Under rare circumstances, Commerce may approve the marketing and ultimate sale of a property, partially or entirely, without the affordability restrictions remaining in place after the sale, at Commerce's sole discretion .

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Circumstances that will be considered may include but are not limited to:

- End of useful life/structural issues.
- Neighborhood issues/concerns/fit.
- Change in demographics or lack of demand for housing by the target population.
- Lack of organization's capacity to continue to provide housing.
- Changing market conditions.

Criteria for amendment may include but are not limited to:

- Property cannot secure qualified tenants.
- Contractor can demonstrate efforts were unsuccessful to transfer the property to another nonprofit (examples include: multiple references for organizations that have been solicited for transfer partnership).
- Location and type of housing may not be appropriate for a specific client type.

The sales process typically takes anywhere from 6-18 months once a contractor first accounts for a good faith effort exploring transfer possibilities, agency approval, followed by marketing and securing a buyer. Obtaining Commerce 's approval before listing the property for sale will help with private market transactions. At a minimum, Commerce may require a public listing of the property with HTF restrictions as a transfer opportunity for eligible entities for a specified time period, including Commerce posting the property on the agency website for a reasonable time period.

Some contracts may allow proceeds from the sale of a property to be reinvested in another eligible lowincome affordable housing project instead of remitting repayment of the loan/grant and shared appreciation to Commerce (refer to Section 202. Eligibility Guidelines). If Commerce forgoes repayment of its loan/grant and/or its shared appreciation, and unless otherwise required in the contract, Commerce at its sole discretion may allow the sale proceeds to be reinvested in other new or existing low-income affordable housing projects, provided that such amounts are securitized by an HTF contract and appropriate legal documents (as typically required on HTF projects). Reinvestment of sale proceeds may also be available for projects that are not currently restricted, but where the Contractor is willing to allow Commerce to restrict and/or monitor these non-portfolio properties as new additions to the lowincome housing portfolio.

Criteria for reinvestment may include but are not limited to:

- The proposed project meets HTF eligibility requirements;
- A new commitment period will start when the new project/site is placed in service;
- A new contract or an update of the old/other contract through amendment will be completed;
- A revised contract secures other non-HTF restricted property, thereby adding new properties to the HTF portfolio; and
- Any projects requesting additional funds for a new site will compete for those funds in a competitive funding round.

## 504.7.1 Sale Where Affordability Restriction Remains in Place (Transfer with Cash Proceeds)

Under certain circumstances, Commerce will approve the transfer of a property where cash proceeds/net proceeds are actualized. In the event of this type of sale, if the proposed buyer agrees to the assumption of underlying HTF debt, covenant requirements and no change in use per the current HTF Contract, then shared appreciation may not be assessed and loan repayments may not be required (i.e., Commerce may not accelerate the note).

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Unless the current contract and legal documents allow otherwise, Commerce will require that the net cash proceeds/ net proceeds be used for improvements/repairs to the property, replenishing the property's capital reserves, and/or improvements/repairs to o ther HTF-financed properties in the contractor's portfolio, all of which will need Commerce's review and approval prior to amending any legal documents.

Asset Management may require a Capital Needs Assessment or Life Cycle Cost Analysis to determine capital contribution requirement(s) to the reserve account(s).

## 504.7.2 Partial Sales or Conveyances

Partial Sales include but are not limited to: Sales of Air Rights, Road Expansions, Condominiumization, Easements and Right of Way expansions, Sales or Transfers of any portion of the property for other purposes.

Partial Sales can also include the sale of one or more site(s) within a Multi-Site/Scatter Site Contract were not all sites are being sold together.

Unless the current contract and legal documents allow otherwise, Commerce will require that the net cash proceeds/net proceeds be used for improvements/repairs to the property, replenishing the property's capital reserves, and/or improvements/repairs to other HTF -financed properties in the contractor's portfolio, all of which will need Commerce's review and approval prior to amending any legal documents.

If a sale affects tenant occupancy, prior to tenant relocation reach out to Commerce and complete an application. See Section 203.3. Tenant Relocation.

## 504.7.3 Sale of Property with Release of Requirements (Private Sale)

If the Project is approved for sale without the affordability requirements remaining in place, then Asset Management will approve the release of affordability requirements prior to sale of the property (technically to occur at the close of escrow). Repayment of the Housing Trust Fund loan or recoverable grant will be based on contract terms and conditions and will include shared appreciation.

## Section 505. Addressing Compliance Issues

When a project or contractor is deemed out of compliance with the terms and conditions of their contract, Asset Management will assess the seriousness of the compliance issue and determine an appropriate course of action. Decisions are based on weighing risks to tenants or the housing portfolio against the costs in terms of money or time to take action against the contractor. Asset Management may engage in technical assistance, a workout strategy, contract termination, or in the worst case, foreclosure or other legal proceedings when working with contractors to address compliance issues.

The state's financial interest in a property is secured by placing liens on any property purchased or constructed with state funds. These liens provide the state with final recourse through the foreclosure and other legal process. Foreclosure is a legal process that is governed by RCW 61.24. In some circumstances, foreclosure proceedings may be initiated by a different funder, at which point the state would coordinate foreclosure activities with this funder.

## Section 506. Final Contract Closeout

At the end of the HTF contract commitment period, a final contract closeout will take place. In order to close out an HTF contract that has completed its commitment period, Asset Management staff will determine if there is an outstanding loan balance and/or accrued interest and whether or not there are any liens or covenants that need to be released. Outstanding loan balances and accrued interest must be paid before final contract closeout.

The contractor will be notified in advance of the commitment period completion date. It is the contractor's responsibility to notify Asset Management if an extension of the contract is desired. If the contractor does not wish to extend the contract, the contract will be closed out once the loan is repaid in full. Upon repayment, HTF-imposed property liens and covenants will be released as applicable, and debt obligations will be considered satisfied.

Commerce encourages projects to continue providing affordable housing after the HTF contract has ended.

Note:  HTF recognizes that as the portfolio ages, additional guidelines may be necessary to provide clarity around how to manage close-outs. This may include clarity around whether contract extensions may be permitted and under what conditions a loan balance may be reduced. This is an area of policy development and will not be finalized without public involvement.

## Section 507. Audit and Insurance Requirements

## 507.1. Audit Requirement

All organizations receiving any Housing Trust Fund monies are, by default, required to provide audit information to Commerce on an annual basis. Contractors are required to submit a copy of their organization's consolidated annual audit to Commerce within nine (9) months of the organization's fiscal year end date. Responses to any unresolved management findings and disallowed or questioned costs should be included with the audit report. The contractor must respond to Commerce's requests for more information and/or take corrective action concerning audit issues within 30 days of the request. Various types of audits could be required, as determined by federal and state requirements related to the amount of funding received in a given year. Audits that may be required include an A-133 audit, a Yellow Book audit, or a Financial Statement Audit.

Payment for the audit is the responsibility of the contractor. Audits are to be performed by a Certified Public Accountant independent of the organization being audited. If the contractor is a state or local government entity, the State Auditor's Office sh all conduct the audit. Contractors failing to provide an audit on an annual basis will be out of compliance with the terms and conditions of their contract.

Note: Compilations and Reviews are not considered audits.

## 507.2. Audit Waiver Request

Commerce may consider a temporary waiver of the Financial Statement Audit requirement for an eligible organization (see Section 507.2.1. Eligible Organization) that submits a written waiver request to Asset Management. The written request must provide evidence of a clear and compelling hardship in providing the required audit. Approval, denial or rescission of an audit waiver is at the sole discretion of

Contractors failing to provide current proof of insurance on an annual basis (if the contract requires so) or upon request will be out of compliance with the terms and conditions of their contract .

## CHAPTER 6: HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAM

## Section 600. Purpose

The purpose of the HTF Homeownership Program is to assist low-income firsttime homebuyers' ability to purchase and live in an affordable home in Washington State. The program offers funding to eligible organizations who administer homeownership projects or programs that create long-term affordability (25 years or longer), as described below in this Chapter.

This chapter outlines the policies used by Commerce in allocating funding and administering the HTF Homeownership Program and contracts. These policies apply to both competitively awarded projects and directly appropriated projects.

Please refer to Chapter 2. Funding Guidelines for general information regarding the award and management of HTF capital funds.

## Section 601. Homeownership Program Eligibility

Applicants should have a thorough understanding of the HTF Homeownership Program in its entirety prior to applying for funding. This includes statutory criteria, programmatic requirements, and the application processes and procedures outlined in Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of this Handbook.

The HTF Homeownership Program provides funding for down payment assistance revolving loan fund (RLF) capitalization grants, new construction, and affordability subsidy for long-term or permanently affordable resale-restricted programs (such as Community Land Trusts or deed restricted programs).

The HTF Homeownership Program provides funds to the homeownership award recipient, known as the 'HTF C ontractor.'

The HTF Contractor uses the grant funding for any of the following activities as identified in the executed HTF contract and as outlined in RCW 43.185A.140(4) including, without limitation:

1. Down Payment Assistance Revolving Loan Fund [Figure 601.8]:
- a. HTF Contractor l oans funds to low-income homebuyers (see Section 601.5. Eligible Homebuyer):
- i. Loans must be secured by a subordinate mortgage payable to the HTF Contractor.
- ii. Homebuyer repays the loan (monthly payments, at resale, or at refinance) to the HTF Contractor.
- iii. HTF Contractor uses this ' program income ' (i.e., the repaid loan and accrued interest) to make NEW loans to NEW homebuyers who meet income eligibility requirements. See details in Section 601.8. Revolving Loan Funds and Program Income.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

## 2. New Construction Funding:

- a. HTF Contractor acquires an interest in real property to develop and construct new homes for purchase by low-income homebuyers. Deed restrictions with a long-term affordability covenant will be placed on the land and subsequent units by Commerce .

## 3. Affordability Subsidy:

- a. HTF Contractor acquires an interest in real property and transfers a portion of that interest using a ground lease with resale restrictions or deed restriction with a long-term affordability covenant to an eligible homebuyer, assuring the property continues to serve successive generations of low-income homebuyers without the need for additional investment. Commerce will also place restrictions on the land for a minimum of 25 years such as deeds and low-income housing covenants (see Section 604.2. Contract &amp; Legal Documents Development).

For all investment approaches : Only the initial investment of HTF funds in the acquisition of a home must satisfy both income-eligibility and first-time homebuyer standards. Resales of homes during the affordability period and reinvestment of down payment assistance funds may be applied to all lowincome homebuyers. The first-time homebuyer limitation is removed if the homes sold, or the funds are reinvested during the 25-year affordability period.

3. Purchase of currently rented/leased and occupied units by renter/lease tenant (e.g., conversion of rental unit to owner occupied unit where existing tenants are not displaced and become the owners).

Housing affordability (defined below in Section 601.7. Affordability) must be reviewed by the HTF Contractor to ensure that the assisted homebuyers are not cost burdened.

Initial homebuyers assisted with HTF funds must meet the low-income first-time homebuyer definition; subsequent homebuyers need only meet the low-income requirement.

## 601.3. Eligible Activities and Types of Assistance

HTF funds may also be used to pay development costs for new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation projects, including acquisition, infrastructure connections on already owned property, and building construction and development soft costs.

- Down payment assistance loans for existing housing.
- Short-term production loans and development funding for the acquisition and/or construction of permanently resale restricted homes.
- Affordability Subsidy to create permanently affordable resale restricted homes.

## Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

## 601.3.1. Down Payment Assistance Loans for Existing Housing

HTF funds may be used for down payment assistance loans to assist low-income first-time homebuyers with the purchase of an existing home or condominium.

The down payment assistance loan to the homebuyer must be in the form of a loan payable to the HTF Contractor at a rate of no more than 3% and secured with a subordinate mortgage.

If the homebuyer cannot afford an additional payment, the down payment assistance funds may be loaned on a zero interest (0%) basis, secured by a subordinate deed of trust and promissory note in favor of the HTF Contractor, with repayment due when affordable, at refinance or sale, or the end of the affordability period (not less than 25 years for first-time homebuyers).

## 601.3.2. Short-term Production Loans and Development Funding

A short-term production loan is used when the HTF Contractor acquires and rehabilitates, or constructs homes and then sells them to qualified low-income homebuyers.

HTF Homeownership Program funds may be used by an eligible nonprofit, government, or tribal organization as described in Section 601.1 to assist in the site acquisition and/or development/construction of land and homes to be sold to eligible homebuyers as 'R esale Restricted Homes. ' 'Resale Restricted Homes' are homes that are subject to long-term recorded restrictions that require the homes to be sold at prices affordable to buyers with low incomes.

The HTF Contractor will ensure long-term affordability through providing Resale Restricted Homes for the preset, statutorily mandated, minimum time-period of 25 years. The HTF Contractor will memorialize provisions that the Resale Restricted Homes remain in effect for the Preset Time into all ground leases, covenants, and deed restrictions. Commerce will also place restrictions on the land for the Preset Time including, without limitation, such restrictions into all deeds and low-income housing covenants (see Section 604.2. Contract &amp; Legal Documents Development).

## 601.3.3 Affordability Subsidy

HTF Homeownership Program funds may be used by eligible organizations described in Section 601.1. Eligible Applicants to create community land trusts and to assist in creating permanently affordable, Resale Restricted Homes. These funds reduce the price of the homes, keeping them affordable for the Preset Time.

The HTF Contractor will ensure long-term affordability through long-term resale restrictions in a ground lease, covenant, and/or deed restriction that lasts for the Preset Time. Commerce will also place restrictions on the land for the Preset Time including, without limitation, including such restrictions into all deeds and low-income housing covenants (see Section 604.2. Contract &amp; Legal Documents Development) .

## 601.4. Ineligible Activities

## HTF funds may not be used for:

- Contractor's overall program administration costs or organizational overhead (except for RLF funds, as noted in in #1 (Down Payment Assistance Revolving Loan Fund) under Section 601 (Homeownership Program Eligibility) and 601.8 (Revolving Loan Funds and Program Income)).

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Homebuyer education and counseling.

See Section 601.3. Eligible Activities and Types of Assistance and Section 601.8. Revolving Loan Funds and Program Income for costs related to the HTF contract that may be eligible for HTF funding.

## 601.5. Eligible Homebuyers

Applicants receiving HTF Homeownership funding from Commerce may only assist low income homebuyers as defined in RCW 43.185A.010, unless otherwise authorized by the legislature:

'Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter…

- (5) "First-time homebuyer" means:
2. (a) An individual or the individual's spouse who has had no ownership in a principal residence during the three-year period ending on the date of purchase of the property;
3. (b) A single parent who has only owned a home with a former spouse while married;
4. (c) An individual who is a displaced homemaker as defined in 24 C.F.R. Sec. 93.2 as it exists on July 23, 2023, or such subsequent date as may be provided by the department by rule,
5. consistent with the purposes of this section, and has only owned a home with a spouse;
6. (d) An individual who has only owned a principal residence not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation in accordance with applicable regulations; or
7. (e) An individual who has only owned a property that is determined by a licensed building inspector as being uninhabitable.
- (6) "Low-income household" means a single person, family or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is less than eighty percent of the median family income, adjusted for household size, for the county where the project is located. '

Whether an eligible homebuyer is a first-time homebuyer will determine the Preset Time that the housing needs to remain as affordable housing. Should funds later be recaptured or repaid by homeowners to the HTF Contractor, then the HTF Contractor must use these 'revolved funds' to assist other low-income homebuyers (with a household income noted in the HTF contract). Likewise, when funds are used as a developer subsidy for property acquisition and result in resale-restricted homes, then once the initial homeowner sells the property, the HTF Contractor shall facilitate the resale to assist other low-income homebuyers. The subsequent homebuyers must be low income but need not meet the definition of first-time homebuyer.

HTF Contractors must verify that the homebuyers assisted with HTF funds are income-eligible by determining the household's annual income prior to providing the HTF assistance by following the low income certification process in Appendix B to this Handbook and using the HUD definition of 'annual income" as defined in 24 CFR 5.609. Commerce will monitor HTF Contractors' compliance with this and other grant recipient activities and requirements as statutorily required under RCW 43.185A.070.

## 601.6. Homebuyer Education

HTF Contractors must ensure that each assisted homebuyer successfully completes a pre-purchase homebuyer education program, certified by the Washington State Housing Finance Commission, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or the Neighborhood Reinvestment Full-Cycle Lending program.

## 601.7. Affordability

Affordable housing is defined in the HTF statute at RCW 43.185A.010(1) as:

- (1) "Affordable housing" means residential housing for rental occupancy which, as long as the
2. same is occupied by low-income households, requires payment of monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, of no more than thirty percent of the family's income. The department must adopt policies for residential homeownership housing, occupied by lowincome households, which specify the percentage of family income that may be spent on monthly housing costs, including utilities other than telephone, to qualify as affordable housing.

In order to apply and receive funds from the HTF Homeownership Program, HTF applicants and HTF Contractors must ensure that the homes assisted with HTF funds are affordable for the homebuyers. For the HTF Homeownership Program, affordability is defined as follows:

In the context of homeownership, affordability occurs when a household's monthly housing costs are generally no more than 38% of monthly household income and total debt is no more than 45% of monthly household income. Housing costs include mortgage principal, interest, property taxes, homeowner insurance, homeowner association fees, and land lease fees, as applicable. Total debt includes other debt and utilities . [AKA: 38% on the 'front end' and 45% on the 'back end']

HTF Contractors must ensure affordability prior to providing HTF assistance to eligible homebuyers. The household income must be determined the same way as it is calculated to determine low income eligibility, which means following the low income certification process described in Appendix B and using the HUD definition of 'annual income" as defined in 24 CFR 5.609.

## 601.8. Revolving Loan Funds and Program Income

HTF funds can be used to capitalize a RLF that provides funding for down payment assistance (DPA) loans that assist low income, first-time homebuyers with the purchase of an existing home or condominium. The DPA loan to the homebuyer must be in the form of a loan payable to the HTF Contractor and secured with a subordinate mortgage

Repayment of this loan re-capitalizes the HTF Contractor's RLF to be reinvested with future low-income homebuyers.

<!-- image -->

RLF program income is the repaid principal and interest received by the HTF Contractor over the course of the residential mortgage loan repayment period or once the HTF-financed home is sold, refinanced, or otherwise has the initial HTF subsidy recaptured.

The HTF Contractor may use up to 10 percent (10%) of this program income for administration of the RLF. 90% of these funds must be used to assist other low-income homebuyers. Throughout the Preset Time, the HTF Contractor must report and certify annually to Commerce on their RLF activity, including program income, administrative costs, and any losses due to default.

HTF Contractors with insufficient RLF program income to support the need in their market may layer a loan they originate from their RLF program income with that of other HTF Contractors originating a loan from their program income, in order to assist additional low-income homebuyers. In such instances, the total assistance provided to the new low-income homebuyer should remain within HTF program guidelines, including the per unit limit described in Section 602.1. Funding Limits. HTF Contractors layering loans from multiple RLF program incomes must coordinate with each other, and report and certify annually the amounts provided to each low-income homebuyer and identify each RLF layered loan partner organization. Commerce will review and aggregate the certified annual reports and may reach out to the HTF Contractor for more information or clarification.

During the homeownership assessment period in a new application round review (prior to receiving a new award), the HTF Contractor' s RLF account balance will be reviewed by Commerce staff. The existing RLF balance may influence the amount of HTF funds awarded in the future.

## Section 602. Homeownership Application Guidelines

Commerce provides all interested homeownership applicants with a set of application forms and instructions that are distinct from the rental projects, in order to accommodate the variety of the homeownership projects and programs undertaken by the HTF.

All HTF application forms are annually updated and available for download from Commerce's HTF webpage.

All applicants should carefully follow the requirements listed in an HTF solicitation for applications, the accompanying NOFA, and the application forms (including published addenda, if any). Requirements listed in the solicitation and NOFA will often supplement or supersede the information provided in this Handbook. In any and every instance where there is a conflict between this Handbook and a solicitation or a NOFA, the solicitation or the NOFA will supersede this Handbook.

It is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain HTF staff guidance in any instance where such a conflict that could affect their application prior to submitting their HTF application.

## 602.1. Funding Limits

As noted in Section 201.3. Funding Limits, Commerce sets HTF competitive award limits in consultation with the Community Advisory Team, a subcommittee of Affordable Housing Advisory Board tasked to advise Commerce on HTF policy. The HTF limits are set in place to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of available funds across the state, project types, and applicant organizations. Commerce reserves the right to adjust the HTF award limits, as necessary for a fair and equitable distribution of

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook funds, and will publish them in this HTF Handbook, NOFAs, and website, so that applicants seeking HTF funding can prepare their applications and project budgets accordingly. Notwithstanding this, as required under RCW 43.185A.140(2), '[a] t least thirty percent of these moneys used in any given funding cycle must be for the benefit of projects located in rural areas of the state as defined by the department. If the department determines that it has not received an adequate number of suitable applications for rural projects during any given funding cycle, the department may allocate unused moneys for projects in non-rural areas of the state. ' Additionally, as required under RCW 43.185A.140(3), '[t] he department must prioritize allocating at least, but not limited to, 10 percent of these moneys used in any given funding cycle to organizations that serve and are substantially governed by individuals disproportionately impacted by homelessness, including black, indigenous, and other people of color and, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender, and other gender-diverse individuals. '

These HTF limits apply to the competitive traditional Homeownership funding. They do not apply to or count against the special or one-time proviso funds, such as portfolio preservation, ultra-high energy efficiency, philanthropic contribution match, or when specified as such in a budget bill proviso. Also, direct appropriations made by the Legislature to specified projects are not included in the HTF award limit calculations. However, applicants should note that direct appropriations and special one-time proviso funds are used by the HTF application review team and included when measuring and scoring the amount of state investment in a project.

The following HTF award limits will be applied by HTF staff when accepting project applications and making competitive awards in the traditional Homeownership funding rounds, as long as the per applicant biennial limit does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the TOTAL funds available in a biennium for traditional Homeownership competitive awards.

## Per project limits:

Project limits are set annually and listed in the Notice of Funding Availability for each specific funding round.

## Per unit limits:

HTF Homeownership Program has a soft cap of $100,000 per unit; any amount above this cap will require a letter and supporting documentation justifying the higher amount. These limits are subject to change, for unit limits see the Notice of Funding Availability for each specific funding round.

Under certain circumstances, Commerce may waive grant limits. Applicants can request a waiver of the per-project limit.

Commerce reserves the right to adjust maximum award amounts available during each competitive funding cycle based on funds available, legislative direction, special funding opportunities, and other unique circumstances that may arise. At no time will Commerce set grant minimums or limits without at least two (2) prior public discussions held at least 30 days prior to the applicable funding cycle(s).

- o Revenue  expectations  (forecasting)  of  the  program  over  the  life  of  the  contract commitment.  The  accounting  system  that  is  used  to  track  the  RLF  fund  should  track sufficient  data  to  ensure  accurate  forecast  projections  to  estimate  the  health  of  the program over time.
- o Non-conforming  estimates  must  be  defined  and  included  when  making  revenue forecasts. Describe  the methodology and history to support the manner in which the organization determines the percentage of non-conforming loans. Non-conforming loans are those loans that may fail to perform in accordance with the contractual terms over

the life of the loan (e.g., 4% of the portfolio may not meet contractual requirements based on historical performance records for borrowers with static income levels).

## · Program Files

- o Records retention requirements, to include procedures for maintaining all files related to the program in an orderly and secure manner for the duration of the Preset Term, which is  a  minimum of 25 years for low-income first-time homebuyers.

Some of the areas assessed as part the Project Review process include:

## Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

## · Project Overview

- o The HTF Contractor develops projects that support the organization and homes that are affordable to targeted homebuyers
- o Proposed project is consistent with the program's design and goals
- o Proposed  project  has  a  realistic  schedule  in  the  program  development  pipeline  The homeownership project can be contracted within 90 days of award receipt AND the homes proposed should be acquired, constructed, or delivered within 3 years of the HTF contract execution date.
- o All financing sources are secured
- o All private and public lending partners (including first mortgages) are identified
- o The proposed project demonstrates effective leveraging of HTF resources

## · Market &amp; Marketing

- o The  applicant  organization  is  in  compliance  with  program  policies,  Fair  Housing regulations, as well as current mortgage and lending standards

## · Administration and Development Roles

- o In-house and contracted roles and responsibilities are clearly defined in the Homeownership Program Manual
- o A project plan is in place

## · Funding and Financing

- o The project is fully funded and does not require current home sales to finance future home construction (e.g., no 'speculative' development strategies). (If the project needs a bridge loan, the application should show the bridge loan in the development budget rather than future homeowner mortgages.)
- o The project effectively leverages other funding resources
- o Other project funding sources are secured
- o Has a financing plan that sets forth accurate project costs, taking into account volatile labor and materials costs, and which demonstrates the project's viability
- o Prior  projects  under  current  HTF  contracts  with  funds  remaining  to  be  drawn  are progressing as anticipated, or have active plans to progress or return unspent funds

## · Property and Construction

- o The location for the project is currently under the project applicant's control. See Section 205.3 Site Control for details regarding 'site control'
- o The site selected is a developable site at a location compatible with the needs of the targeted homebuyer population
- o The site selected is zoned appropriately for the proposed project. (Due to speed in which these  projects  are  expected  to  move  to  contract,  inappropriate  zoning  may  have  a deleterious impact on funding.)
- o A thorough environmental review of the site has been completed in accordance with the NOFA or solicitation for applications requirements
- o A construction cost estimate has been prepared by an independent entity in accordance with the NOFA or solicitation for applications requirements
- o Complete budgets have been prepared and support all aspects of project development
- o The project follows, at a minimum, the most recent ESDS building standards

## 602.3. Local Support

The application for HTF Homeownership funds should demonstrate support from local organizations and local government for the proposed homeownership project.

Commitment of funds for capital development from local organizations and/or local government is a strong indicator of support. Other indicators of local support are donations from individuals, waivers of fees including impact fees, utility hook-ups, or building permits.

## 602.4. Readiness

The proposed HTF Homeownership project should be ready to execute a contractual agreement within 90 days of receiving an award. Indicators of readiness include:

## Program specific :

- Waiting list of eligible program participants
- Commitment of all other funds financing the proposed project

## Site specific ( may not be applicable to down-payment assistance or affordability subsidy business models) :

- Site control
- Absence of environmental hazards, or presence of mitigation plan with appropriate funding
- Consistency with current zoning.
- Well-developed architectural plans.
- Permits have been obtained; or permit applications have been submitted to the local building department -copies of notes from a pre-submission meeting with the local planning department will support a readiness to proceed claim

## 602.3. Need, Demand, and Market Analysis

The required market analysis at the time of application allows the homeownership program to select an appropriate target market and set priorities for programs, products and services. The analysis should focus on what the potential customer needs and wants, to include what they are willing to pay for and at what price.

The process typically includes:

- Defining the geographic area and consumer base to be served;
- Identifying unmet needs;
- Collecting data regarding supply and demand, including competition; and
- Analyzing the information to determine a realistic market niche.

Commerce staff will review the scope of the analysis to determine whether there is evidence the applicant has collected information relevant to the target homebuyer and will assess whether or not the program design aligns with the results gathered.

## Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

## 602.4. Sustainable Building Requirement

All affordable housing projects or programs receiving state capital funds from the HTF are subject to RCW 39.35D.080 and must incorporate the ESDS in the design, construction, or rehabilitation of the properties. See Section 207. Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard for detailed information regarding ESDS.

## 602.5. Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment

A Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) is required, at application, for subdivisions and mobile home parks. The Phase 1 ESA must:

- Follow the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) E1527 standard
- Be dated no more than 12 months prior to the HTF application due date (Note: A letter updating a  Phase  1  assessment  completed  more  than  12  months  prior  to  the  application  due  date  is acceptable.)

If the Phase 1 ESA identifies any environmental hazards and recommends a Phase 2 ESA, then the latter is required and must be included in the application when available. Please refer to Section 205.4.1. Phase I Environmental Site Assessment for additional guidance.

## When using HTF funds for Affordability Subsidy the following items are required:

Mold and Meth Testing is required on all homes that are not newly constructed (i.e., homes that have been previously lived in).

Asbestos and Lead Based Paint Testing is required for homes built prior to 1978.

## 602.6. Appraisal

Commerce requires a current property tax assessment or a full appraisal supporting the purchase price of the property for projects that involve the purchase of real property and/or building(s).

- If a current property tax assessment does not support the purchase price of real property and/or building(s), the applicant must complete an appraisal.
- If  the  funding  applicant  already  owns  the  property,  if  the  project  does  not  need  acquisition funding, or if the property is being donated to the project, then an appraisal is not required.

## Appraisals must be:

- Based on the highest and best use.
- Conducted by State Licensed Appraiser who is licensed or duly authorized by the Washington State Department of Licensing to conduct real estate appraisals in Washington State.
- Dated no more than 6 months prior to the application due date.
- o A letter updating an appraisal completed more than 6 months prior to the application due date is acceptable.

Projects that demonstrate site control (Section 205.3. Site Control) prior to contract execution rather than at time of application must satisfy the appraisal requirement prior to the release of funds.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Scattered site homeownership projects and down payment assistance programs must provide appraisals at the time of purchase. Appraisals provided as part of an overall funding package, and accepted by the primary lender, will satisfy this requirement.

## 602.7. Developer/Project Management Fee

An HTF Contractor's combined project management fee and developer fee must not exceed 10%.

The project management fee may only be used to pay for staff time and project-related costs during the development/ implementation period. Staff time and project-related costs must be clearly documented and differentiated from other duties not related to the general operations of the funding recipient.

Review Section 204.7 Developer Fees for details regarding developer and project management fees.

If a third-party developer is hired, a copy of the Development Consultant Agreement must be provided to the  HTF  Project  Manager.  Please  review  the  minimum  information  that  the  Development  Consultant agreement must contain as outlined in Section 205.1. Development Consultant Agreement.

## 602.8. Project Administration Funds

The HTF Contractor may not use HTF funds for program administration or overhead, other than or in addition to the Developer/Project Management Fee described above. The HTF Contractor may retain up to 10% of designated HTF RLF program income, as defined in the Glossary and described in Section 601.8. Revolving Loan Funds and Program Income to pay for direct project administration costs.

## Section 603. Award Revisions

In certain circumstances, award revisions may be allowed once an award has been made but the project has not yet been contracted. Award revisions may be considered for substantial changes in deal structure, overall concept, site issues, construction review changes, or other substantial changes that may be beyond the control of the applicant.

The process for award revisions is as follows:

- Applicant submits documentation of changes, including, but not limited to, updated development budget and development schedule as well as an explanation of the need for proposed changes. This information may closely follow the amendment application.
- HTF  management  will  review  and  likely  present  recommendations  to  the  Housing  Division Assistant Director for final approval.

This process may happen at any time after an award has been made and prior to contract execution. If the  contract  has  not  been  executed  within  the  negotiated  timeframe,  this  process  may  be  used  to determine  if  the  award  commitment  should  be  extended,  modified,  or  terminated.  If  the  award  is rescinded, the applicant may need to reapply for funding.

Monetary award revisions must follow the procedures as set forth in Section 607. Placed In Service.

## Section 604. Contract Development

The contract development phase includes contract and legal documents drafting, review, and execution. The HTF Homeownership contract and legal documents will be drafted when the HTF Project Manager receives documentation from the HTF Contractor necessary for the contract. The HTF contract should be executed in accordance with the Notice of Funding Availability requirements, the submitted and awarded application, and the timeline and requirements described in this Handbook.

## 604.1. HTF Project Manager 's Role

The HTF Project Manager's key job responsibility is to protect the state's interest through developing and implementing scopes of work to deliver the creation or preservation of low-income affordable housing units.

The HTF Project Manager is the primary contact for communications related to negotiations, contract development and execution, disbursement of funds, and any other issues throughout the development phase of the project. HTF Project Manager responsibilities include:

- Negotiating  specific  terms  and  conditions  of  the  recoverable  grant,  as  appropriate,  including repayment provisions.
- Communicating and coordinating regarding the development and execution of the contract and related legal documents.
- Ensuring all conditions of the award and pre-contracting requirements are met prior to contract execution.
- Reviewing and approving the final project budget and schedule prior to contract execution, and any revisions that occur during development.
- Reviewing and approving all draw requests and back-up documentation.
- Overseeing the project until issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
- Reviewing and approving all placed in service documentation.
- Ongoing long-term management of the project during the Monitoring and Compliance period.

## 604.2. Contract &amp; Legal Documents Development

Commerce will draft the HTF contract, and all applicable legal documents (as described below) based on current state law, current HTF policies, and the information received in the HTF application.

All of  Commerce's legal  documents  are subject to the  review and  approval of the  Stat e's  Assistant Attorney General (AAG).

A typical set of Commerce documents includes at a minimum:

1. The HTF Homeownership contract,
2. A promissory note in the amount of the contracted amount between Commerce and the HTF Contractor;
3. Property/land restrictions such as deeds and low-income housing covenants (for the Preset Term which is a minimum of 25 years) on the HTF funded properties WHEN the land or the real property (wholly or partly) is owned, or subject to a long-term lease, by the HTF Contractor. Mixed use properties may be subject to specific securitization requirements that comply with applicable

state law and are project specific based on the intended use. Homes where the land is owned by the homebuyer may have different requirements.

The following matrix shows the standard legal documents for each project type between Commerce and the HTF Contractor. There may be additional requirements for homebuyer documents.

|                                  | Contract   | Deed of Trust   | **Covenant   | Promissory Note   |
|----------------------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Down Payment Assistance          | X          |                 |              | X                 |
| Affordability Subsidy            | X          | X               | X            | X                 |
| New Construction& Rehabilitation | X          | X               | X            | X                 |

Any issues identified during the pre-contract development must be resolved before the contract and legal documents are drafted.

All non-HTF funds intended to finance the project must be committed by the other funders before the HTF contract is executed.

The  HTF  contract  is  comprised  of  two  parts: Specific  Terms  and  Conditions and General  Terms  and Conditions .  The  boilerplate  language  for  the  HTF contract  and related legal documents has been preapproved by the Office of the Attorney General. The General Terms and Conditions are not negotiable .

Very limited revisions to the Specific Terms and Conditions or other legal documents may be allowed, as noted below. Any proposed changes to HTF contract documents must first be discussed with the HTF Project Manager. Revisions solely to improve the accuracy or clarity of terms may be considered and approved by Commerce staff. More substantive changes require review and approval by Commerce's AAG and should be expected to add up to 3 weeks to the timeline for execution.

HTF Contractors may be required to submit plans and specifications to a third-party construction inspector selected by Commerce for new construction projects at the HTF Project Manager 's discretion ,  prior to contract execution.

## 604.3. Contract Execution

It is the HTF Contractor's responsibility to be aware of their deadlines, keep their HTF Project Manager informed in advance of the schedule, and allow sufficient time for contract execution.

HTF Contractors should allow  a  minimum  of  two  (2)  weeks  for  Commerce  to obtain  final  signatures. Commerce cannot guarantee its ability to respond to rush requests.

Once  all  documents  have  been  received  and  executed  by  Commerce,  Commerce  will  return  a  fully executed contract to the contractor. Documents that are to be recorded are sent directly to the chosen escrow company or to the legal counsel handling the recordation.

## Section 605. Contract Management During Development

The  purpose  of  this  Section  is  to  outline  the  process  for  managing  and  overseeing  homeownership projects from contract execution to completion of all activities described in the contract's Scope of Work. This is referred to as the 'development phase.'

## 605.1. Timelines and Work Plan Schedules

The HTF Contractor must draw all funds and produce all contracted homeownership units within 3 years from the HTF contract execution date (i.e., development phase can be up to 3 years long). Not meeting this requirement may result in the contract amount being reduced and/or the HTF contract terminated.

The project schedule is an important document that will be closely tracked. Changes to the schedule or project completion date must be documented in a revised schedule and sent to the HTF Project Manager. The project schedule must include key benchmark dates for completion of the project.

The HTF Project Manager may require monthly project status reports from the HTF Contractor to ensure the project stays on budget and on schedule.

## 605.2. Site Visits

At the HTF Project Manager 's discretion, a site visit may occur at any time during the development phase. All files must be made available to the HTF Project Manager as requested during a site visit.

## 605.3. Construction Review and Inspection

At Commerce's discretion, Commerce may request a third-party construction reviewer to provide preconstruction review and construction draw review services. The HTF Project Manager will review and approve construction draws based upon recommendations from the third-party construction reviewer.

## 605.3.1. Pre-Construction Review

The purpose of the pre-construction review is to:

- Ensure the budget is adequate for the proposed project based on a review of the project's plans and specifications; and
- Determine whether or not the proposed plans are appropriate for the project.

The HTF Project Manager determines the timeframe for the third-party construction review, depending on the readiness of the plans and specifications and other negotiated conditions. The third-party reviewer provides the HTF Contractor with a list of the items needed to complete the review. Once the review is complete, the third-party reviewer sends a report to the HTF Project Manager. The HTF Project Manager may send the review to the HTF Contractor to address any concerns raised.

## 605.4. Drawing Funds and Vouchering Process

The HTF Project Manager reviews and approves all invoice vouchers from the HTF Contractor. Unless otherwise specified in the HTF Homeownership contract, draws will be made pro-rata determined by the number of homeownership units contracted and the contract amount.

The HTF Project Manager will make a determination whether each invoice or bill is an eligible cost. If an invoice  or  bill  is  determined  to  be  an  ineligible  cost,  the  amount  must  be  subtracted  from  the  total requested. The contractor may be asked to submit an explanation of any budget changes.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

All expenses for reimbursement must be no more than 12 months old. Allowable costs incurred prior to the  execution  of  a  contract  may  be  reimbursed  when  approval  is  granted  by  Commerce  prior  to  the execution of the contract. (Refer to Section 202.5.1. Eligibility of Prior Costs.)

Funds must be drawn using the online Contracts Management System portal (CMS) using the Secure Access  Washington  (SAW)  application.  Please  visit  https://www.commerce.wa.gov/about-us/contractmanagement-system-portal/ for instructional videos, registration information, and other useful technical assistance items.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  HTF  Contractor  to  authorize  receipt  of  payments  from  the  State  of Washington via Electronic Funds Transfer by completing and submitting a Statewide Payee Registration form to the Department of Enterprise Services (DES). The process to register as a Statewide Payee is also described on the Department of Enterprise Services (DES) webpage.

The basic criteria for approval of invoice vouchers are:

- The payee must be the nonprofit organization with which Commerce has a direct contractual relationship  (i.e.,  the  HTF  Contractor).  A  CMS  Access  Form  must  be  approved  by  the  Project Manager to allow access to the CMS system. A contractor signed A-19 will be required if the Project Manager is inputting the draw request on behalf of the contractor.
- The  HTF  contract  must  be  fully  executed  and  all  applicable  requirements  met  (e.g.,  proof  of liability insurance, approved ESDS Plan).
- Draw  requests  must  correspond  with  the  development  budget  categories.  For  each  invoice voucher submitted, an invoice voucher summary must list each invoice with Development Budget line-item detail.
- The third-party construction inspector must conduct their construction inspections on behalf of Commerce to verify progress and compliance with plans and specifications.
- All invoice vouchers must have back-up documentation justifying the amount requested. This may include  a  final  settlement  statement,  Homebuyer  Information  Form,  invoices  for  services rendered and materials delivered, or bills from the HTF Contractor for developer fees. Incorrect or incomplete vouchers may be returned to the HTF Contractor for correction and resubmission. A detailed list of required documentation follows.
- All contractor expenses over $1000 must list subcontractor names along with the UBI for that subcontractor.

## 605.4.1. Required Documentation

Requests  to  draw  funds  from  an  executed  contract  must  be  submitted  online  with  documentation supporting each reimbursable item. The supporting documentation is evaluated for expense eligibility and consistency with the line items in the Development Budget.

HTF Contractors should allow up to 18 business days to receive payment after submitting a properly completed invoice voucher and all required supporting documentation.

NOTE:  if the HTF Contractor's SAW account has been established by the Contractor to receive a paper check (e.g., a 'warrant') rather than electronic funds transfer (EFT), an additional 21 business days

may be added to this processing time by the state agency that prints warrants for vendor payment -This process is outside of Commerce's control. There is no way to expedite this process . Commerce strongly recommends receiving funds through EFT.

The following includes a checklist of minimum items to include with a request for funds and the process to request the funds.

The checklist below identifies the minimum items necessary to complete a request for reimbursement from an executed HTF contract through the Secure Access Washington (SAW) Contract Management System (CMS), or their successor programs [https://secureaccess.wa.gov/myAccess/saw/select.do]:

1. Complete A19 Invoice, submitted through SAW/CMS
2. Completed Diverse Spend Reportable Expenses Template for any contractor, sub-contractor, and sub-sub-contractor expense that is equal to, or greater than $1,000 : http://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Reportable-Expenses-Guidefinal.pdf

NOTE:  if the expenses for reimbursement are individually less than $1,000 each, then the Diverse Spend Reportable Expenses Template is NOT required

- NOTE:  The listed financing sources must match the total amount financed as identified on the
3. Complete and Sig ned 'Homebuyer Information Form' Final Settlement Statement
4. Evidence of first-time homebuyer eligibility and income certification (e.g., program documents used to income certify homebuyer)
5. Evidence of homebuyer counseling or education (e.g., certificate of completion)
6. Appraisal or Property Assessed Value (when an appraisal is not available) that matches or exceeds purchase price
7. Signed  Purchase  and  Sale  agreement,  including  evidence  that  all  contingencies  have  been satisfactorily addressed
8. Preliminary Settlement Statement
9. Evidence that HTF funds are secured by a deed of trust, ground lease, or deed restriction, if HTF funds will be included in the closing escrow process. If not, this will be due to Commerce as soon as completed and recorded.
10. For DPA closing with HTF funds used at escrow, the escrow instruction will indicate that the Final Settlement Statement and a copy of the Deed of Trust be transmitted back to the HTF by the escrow/title company.
11. Final  Settlement  Statement  with  separate  line  items  disclosing  the  following  public  funding sources at a minimum:
- a. HTF contribution from active contract, and
- b. Any HTF revolved loan funds applied to the purchase, and
- c. All other public sources of funding (city, county, federal), and

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- d. All private sources of funding (e.g., private lender mortgage or mortgage provided by the contactor).

When  using HTF funds for construction purposes, then include the following items for reimbursement for construction expenses prior to the sale of a home:

 All receipts, invoices, bills of sale, etc. for supplies, contractor expenses, architect expenses, fees, etc. related to construction and infrastructure costs for which reimbursement is sought

 An  updated  construction  schedule  reflecting  the  status  of  the  project  including  permit inspections, anticipated certificate of occupancy receipt date, and any outstanding construction impediments (e.g., materials, weather, labor, unanticipated site challenges, etc.)

 An  updated  ESDS  Binder  if  applicable  (see  Section  207.  Evergreen  Sustainable  Development Standard)

 Third-party inspector construction review, if applicable

When using HTF funds for Affordability Subsidy, the following items are required:

 Mold and Meth Testing is required on all homes that are not newly constructed (i.e., homes that have been previously lived in)

 Asbestos and Lead Based Paint Testing is required for homes built prior to 1978

The process for all types of homeownership project reimbursement (e.g., down payment assistance, selfhelp, developer subsidy, etc.) is, at a minimum, as follows:

1. HTF Contractor uploads original vouchers and back-up documentation , as outlined above to the HTF Project Manager through SAW/CMS (described above). Commerce may require a third-party review of all vouchers and back-up documentation for expenditures prior to HTF Project Manager approval.
2. HTF Project Manager and the third-party reviewer (if applicable) evaluates the reimbursement request and the project status as of the date of the draw request for alignment with the agreed upon Development Budget and the number of homeowners to be assisted.
- a. If any Development Budget line items are being overspent by 10% or more, then the HTF Project Manager may request an updated Development Budget and written clarification outlining the circumstances surrounding the changes to the initially established budget.
- b. The draw amount must be proportional to the number of homeowners to be assisted (e.g., if the contract is for $600,000 to assist 10 homeowners, then each draw should be no greater than $60,000 per individual homeowner).

If the amount to be drawn appears greater than the allowed investment amount per homeowner, the HTF Contractor will be asked to clarify both:

- i. Why it needs the greater amount for an individual client (an expensive real estate market is insufficient support in this instance) and

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- ii. How it intends to meet its contractual obligation with a lowered investment amount per future homeowner.
3. HTF Project Manager approves eligible costs for payment .
4. Commerce fiscal office processes the payment .
5. The HTF Project Manager may require that all legal documentation, updated budget, updated work schedule, and other required documentation be submitted prior to approval of a draw.

The  HTF  Contractor  should  allow  up  to 18  business  days to  receive  payment  after  submitting  a properly completed invoice voucher and all required supporting documentation. NOTE:  if the contractor choses to receive a paper check (e.g., a 'warrant') rather than electronic funds transfer (EFT), an additional 21 days may be added to this processing time by the state agency that prints warrants for vendor payment -there is no way to expedite this process . Commerce strongly recommends receiving funds through EFT.

NOTE: Commerce reserves the right to request additional information, data, or progress reports when disbursing funds, which may increase the time in which a draw is processed.

See also Section 204.7. Developer Fees, Section 204.11. Hold Back of Funds, and Section 402.4.4. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).

## 605.4.2. If the First Voucher Is for Acquisition

If HTF funds are used for acquisition of land or housing, then the preliminary closing statement prepared by the title company or escrow agent will serve as back-up documentation for the voucher. An appraisal will be required if it was not already included with the HTF application. The final closing statement must be submitted when available. HTF Contractors should notify the HTF Project Manager about upcoming closing dates well in advance to ensure availability of funds.

## 605.5. Desk Monitoring

Oversight  of  the  HTF  Homeownership  contract  to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  project  during  the development phase is primarily accomplished through ongoing communication between the HTF Project Manager and the HTF Contractor, and by receipt and review of required voucher documentation and status reports.

HTF Contractors should be aware of the documentation requirements by referring to their contract and this  Handbook  and  should  request  contractor  training  and  technical  assistance  from  the  HTF  Project Manager if needed.

In addition to collecting all the required documentation through the vouchering process described above, HTF Contractors may also be asked for regular progress reports during the development phase.

## Section 606. Contract Amendments

Amendments made to executed HTF contracts are intended to address emergent needs. Increasing or decreasing an award before there is an executed contract is not considered an amendment but rather a revision to the award (see Section 604 above).

## 606.1. Technical Amendments

Technical amendments are reviewed and acted upon on a case-by-case basis. They include, but are not limited to, an extension of the development phase completion date, revisions to the grant/loan terms and conditions, and revisions to the target population(s).

- HTF Contractors must submit amendment requests in writing to the HTF Project Manager if the project is not placed in service (see Section 607. Placed in Service below).
- The request must describe  the  proposed changes  in  detail  and  provide  justification  for  these changes.
- The  HTF  Project  Manager  and  HTF  management  will  review  the  request  and  make  a recommendation to the Assistant Director who will approve or deny the amendment request.

Amendments to executed contracts will follow a process similar to contract execution.

## Section 607. Placed In Service

The purpose of this section is to outline what occurs after the development phase ends and the HTF Homeownership project is 'Placed in Service .'

## 607.1. Homebuyer Information Form

The Homebuyer Information Form is required and must be provided to the HTF Project Manager for each homebuyer prior to beginning the Placed in Service process. For projects that include down payment assistance,  the  form  should  accompany  the  voucher/draw  request.  The  form  is  necessary  because  it provides Commerce with demographic and eligibility data such as household size and income. (Also see Section 605.4. Drawing Funds and Vouchering Process above.)

## 607.2. Placed In Service Process

The Placed in Service process will vary depending on the project type, HTF-funded activities, and other funding  sources  in  the  project.  Homeownership  projects  must  be  100%  complete  and  occupied  in accordance with the contracted scope of work in order to be placed in service.

At a minimum, regardless of homeownership approach (e.g., sweat-equity, down payment assistance, community land trust), all homeownership projects must be placed in service within 3 years of contract execution .  Projects  not  placed  in  service  within  3  years  of  contract  execution  are  considered  noncompliant with Commerce's HTF program guidelines and contract requirements .

Once the HTF contracted activities as stated in the HTF contract have been completed, and all of the qualified homebuyer transactions are complete (i.e., the development phase is complete), the HTF Project Manager will  initiate  a  placed  in  service  file  review  to  ensure  that  all  legal  documentation  has  been received and that all necessary fiscal, administrative, and programmatic management documents are in place. The HTF Contractor will be evaluated on responsiveness in submitting all required documents and information to Commerce within a designated timeframe and the ability to market homes to a targeted client base.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

The process may include a site visit by HTF staff, as well as a HTF Contractor and developer performance evaluation.

If the HTF Project Manager decides to perform a site visit, HTF staff will notify the HTF Contractor in writing of any issues or concerns identified during the visit as well as regarding the necessary corrective action and a timeframe for completing the corrective action.

## 607.3. Certified Final Project Costs

The  HTF  Contractor  must  submit  to  Commerce  their  final  development  costs  certification  when  the project is placed in service.

## 607.4. Contractor and Developer Performance Evaluation

The HTF Contractor 's and developer's overall performance will be evaluated based on the parties' ability to complete the project according to the schedule and within the stated budget and to deliver the number of homes specified in the HTF contract.

Failure on the part of the HTF Contractor and/or developer to deliver the following will adversely reflect on the capacity of the contractor, and may negatively impact future HTF awards:

- Required documentation in a timely manner;
- Appropriate communication with HTF staff; and
- Deliverables as identified in the HTF contract.

The purpose of HTF Contractor and developer performance measures is:

- To recognize successes and best practices.
- To mitigate risks that might jeopardize the long-term viability of the housing.
- To highlight areas that can benefit from technical assistance.

Note: Organizations are evaluated on their performance regarding timely submission of documents and an appropriate or agreed to level of communication with the HTF Project Manager.

Section  602.2.  Assessment  Elements  describes  the  process  used  to  assess  organizational  capacity, program design, and the proposed project. The 'end of project' contractor and developer performance will be evaluated based on the following four areas:

- Pre-Contracting
- Contract and Development
- Placed in Service
- Overall Performance

## Section 608. Annual Reports

## 608.1. Annual Report Submittals

Annual reporting is a requirement of all HTF contracts. The annual reporting period is a calendar year beginning January 1 and ending December 31. Annual reports for homeownership projects are due on July 31 of each year. This date may change in the future, in which case Commerce will provide reasonable notification to the HTF Contractors. Projects are required to begin submitting their annual reports on July 31 following the year the project was placed in service.

Commerce will provide the HTF Contractors with the necessary form (via Word/Excel template or an online system) to complete their annual report. The reports will require information including, but not limited to: homeownership model, current loan statuses, length of homeownership, reasons for property sales  or  foreclosures  (if  any),  revolving  fund  activities,  administrative  expenses,  AMI  of  homeowners served with RLF or through property resales, homeowner demographics, household size, change in value of HTF subsidy, etc.

Failure to submit timely, complete, and accurate annual reports may result in the HTF Contractor being considered out of compliance with the terms and conditions of their HTF contract. HTF Contractors may be asked to re-submit reports which are incomplete or contain erroneous data. Failure to correct and resubmit an annual report when required can also place the HTF Contractor out of compliance.

Note: Delinquent reports can affect consideration in future HTF funding rounds or other HTF/Commerce funding for the applicant organization.

## 608.2. Annual Report Reviews

Annual  reports  will  be  reviewed  by  Commerce  staff.  Potential  contract  compliance  issues  and performance concerns may be identified during the annual report review.

## In Compliance:

Projects with annual report submissions that do not require additional inquiry will receive notification from Commerce that no contract compliance or performance issues were identified.

## Compliance Concerns:

Projects demonstrating potential contract compliance and/or performance concerns will receive a letter outlining the areas of concern.

Projects identified as being potentially out of compliance with the terms of the HTF contract are required to provide a written response within 30 days of receipt of the annual report review.

In  the  event  of  a  foreclosure,  the  HTF  Contractor  shall  report  to  their  Commerce  project  manager immediately upon receiving notice of foreclosure. The HTF Contractor will state a foreclosure (i.e., loss of property)  on  the  annual  report  and  work  with  Commerce  to  update  and  release  any  documents  as needed.

## Disability  Access  Requirements  in  New  Construction  Housing Projects Receiving Public Funding in Washington State

Housing projects in Washington State that receive support from public funding are subject to several overlapping sets of requirements related to ensuring accessibility for people who have disabilities. These include  the  Federal  Fair  Housing  Act  (42  U.S.C.  §3604  et  seq.),  the  Washington  State  Law  Against Discrimination (RCW 49.60.222), the Washington State Building Code (WAC 52-50), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §12132 et seq.) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. §794). The applicability  of  each  of  these  laws  and  their  enacting  regulations  must  be  considered  in  turn  when determining which disability access requirements and design standards apply to any particular housing construction project receiving support from public funds. Often several, or all, will apply. In which case, the applicable requirements must be viewed collectively, and in each instance where there is a difference in scoping or design standard, the most stringent among those applicable must be met.

## Standards Applicable to All Multifamily Housing Projects:

The  Federal  Fair  Housing  Act,  Washington  State  Law  Against  Discrimination,  and  Washington  State Building  Code  apply  to most  residential  buildings,  regardless  of whether  they  are  privately  owned  or publicly assisted.

Guidance regarding the design standards applicable under the Fair Housing Act is provided in the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (24 CFR Part 100). The Washington State Building Code is the applicable standard for the Washington State Law Against Discrimination. The State Building Code is substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, and in some areas the state code is more stringent than the federal guidelines. In any case, the most stringent rules apply to housing in Washington State. Of all the accessibility requirements that apply to publicly assisted housing projects, only the Washington State Building Code is enforced by local building code officials. Those responsible for publicly assisted housing  projects  may  not  rely  on  local  building  code  officials  to  explain  or  interpret  the  accessibility requirements under the other applicable laws, nor may those officials waive any requirements under those laws.

## Standards Applicable to Federally Assisted Housing Projects:

In addition to the standards cited above, projects benefiting from federal funds in the amount of $2,700 or more, must also comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Section 504 scopes the required number of accessible units by project, rather than by residential building or facility, making the facility type irrelevant.

## 24 CFR 8.22 requires, in relevant part, that:

- (a) New multifamily housing projects (including public housing and Indian housing projects as required by Sec. 8.25) shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
- (b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units or at least one unit in a multifamily housing project, whichever is greater, shall be made accessible for persons with mobility impairments. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in Sec. 8.32 is accessible for purposes of this section. An additional two percent of the units (but not less than one unit) in such a project shall be accessible for persons with hearing or vision impairments.

These required accessible units are to be distributed, to the extent feasible, throughout projects and sites and available in a sufficient range of sizes and amenities to allow people with disabilities a range of living options comparable to those who do not have a disability (24 CFR 8.26).

The Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard (UFAS 24 CFR part 40) is the design standard under Section 504, except that "UFAS may not be used to waive or lower the minimum of five percent accessible units required by sec. 8.22 (b) or to apply the minimum only to projects of 15 or more dwelling units," (24 CFR 8.32 (d)) and except to the extent that these projects may also be subject to additional requirements in those areas in which the State Building Code is more stringent.

## Standards Applicable to Projects Funded by State or Local Government

Title  II  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  applies  to  any  housing  project  that  receives  financial assistance through an entity of state or local government. If all or part of that assistance is in the form of federal  funds  that  pass  through  a  state  or  local  government  entity  to  the  project  must  follow  the requirements of the 2010 Design Standards, including both the Title II regulations at 28 CFR 35.151; the 2004 ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) at 36 CFR part 1191, appendices B and D 1 , Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Washington State Building Code.

The residential scoping requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) are as follows:

234.1.1 Accessible Dwelling Units. In residential facilities, at least five percent, but not less than one unit, of the total number of dwelling units in a facility shall comply with 1101 and 1102.

EXCEPTION : Where residential facilities contain four or less dwelling units, at least five percent, but not less than one unit, of the total number of dwelling units in the project shall comply with 1101 and 1102.

234.1.2 Accessible Dwelling Units, Alterations. Where dwelling units are altered or added, the requirements of 234 shall apply only to the dwelling units being altered or added until the number of accessible dwelling units complies with the minimum number required for new construction.

234.1.3 Communication Features. In residential facilities, at least two percent, but not less than one unit, of the total number of dwelling units in a facility shall comply with 1101 and 1103.

EXCEPTION : Where residential facilities contain four or less dwelling units, at least two percent, but not less than one unit, of the total number of dwelling units in the project shall comply with 1101 and 1103.

234.1.4 Communication Features, Alterations. Where dwelling units are altered or added, the requirements of 234 shall apply only to the dwelling units being altered or added until the number

1 https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#2010-standards-for-state-and-localgovernment-facilities-title-ii

of dwelling units with accessible communication features complies with the minimum number required for new construction.

234.1.5 Dispersion. Dwelling units required to comply with 1102, and dwelling units required to comply with 1103 shall be dispersed among the various types of dwelling units in the facility and shall provide choices of dwelling units comparable to and integrated with those available to other residents.

EXCEPTION :  Single  level  dwelling  units  shall  be  permitted  where  spaces  and  amenities  are equivalent to those provided in multi-level dwelling units.

ADAAG would also provide the applicable design standards for such projects, except to the extent that they may also be subject to more stringent provisions under the State Building Code.

## Household  Income  Calculations  for  Commerce 's State  Funded Projects

These guidelines are intended to assist Commerce's State Housing Trust Fund (HTF) funding recipients (contractors) in  calculating a household's income in order to meet the income eligibility and housing affordability requirements established by these three programs (as defined in statute and in this HTF Handbook). These guidelines apply to both homeownership and multifamily/rental contracts.

Household income consists of the gross income from ALL members of the household 18 years and older and includes both earned and unearned income anticipated for the next 12 months based on their current income situation. The income of absent household members must also be counted if they are to be included as a member of the household occupying the HTF-assisted unit/home. The contractor must use the HUD's definition of 'annual income" as defined in 24 CFR 5.609. If the contract requires so, the contractor should use the adjusted gross income as defined in their HTF contract.

HTF contractors must verify that each household occupying an HTF-assisted unit/home is income-eligible, and that the unit/home will be affordable for the household, by determining the household's annual income prior to  occupancy  through  the  certification  process.  Thereafter,  except  for  homeownership projects, the contractors must recertify the tenant's household income for every year of occupancy during the HTF contract commitment period. Refer to Section 501.1.1 for additional information.

In determining household eligibility and housing affordability, standard industry practice is to project or 'annualize' a household's anticipated income. Annualization is calculated by averaging income data that is recent and currently available and extrapolating it to obtain an annualized amount. Annualization must not be confused with annual salary or annual income, or income earned during a calendar year (JanuaryDecember). Annualization is the projection of what a household is likely to earn over the next 12 months .

## INCOME

To determine household eligibility, the annual income means:

- Gross wages and salaries, overtime pay, commissions, fees, tips and other compensation for personal services from employment
- Net income from the operation of a business or profession includes salaries paid to adult family members, net income from the business and any withdrawal of cash or assets from the operation of business, except to the extent the withdrawal is reimbursement of cash or assets invested in the operation by the family.
- Gross amount of unearned income.
- Interest, dividends, and other net income of any kind from real or personal property.
- For a complete list of income to include and or exclude refer to 24 CFR 5.609.

Eligibility is determined by comparing the total anticipated 12-months of income to that of the applicable maximum allowed income, as outlined in the HTF contract, and which is based on household size (i.e., number  of  members)  and  county  of  which  the  property  is  located.  Income  limits  are  published  by Commerce  every year and can be found at https://www.commerce.wa.gov/multifamily-rentalhousing/compliance-reporting/.

## Verification of Income and Assets

For properties that have received funding from the State Housing Trust Fund ; verification of income must be done through the use of third-party verification and for assets when the households net assets exceed $50,000.00.

[Federal reform coming through the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act (HOTMA) will be assessed by Commerce in due time.]

## Enterprise Income Verification (EIV)

The use of EIV is not permitted as income verification for any program outside of the rental assistance programs identified by HUD. Due to these restriction verifications obtained through EIV will not meet the requirements of obtaining third party verification.

## Employment Income

For State Housing Trust Fund, if the employer does not provide third-party verification the applicant can provide one of the following:

- Six consecutive paystubs
- Employer payroll history report for past 12 months - if income is sporadic, payroll history report for past three years or length of employment if less than three years, and/or
- Work Number Printout

Note: Washington State law requires employers to keep employees' payroll records for at least three years. Employees have the right to request copies of these records at any reasonable time. The employer can keep the records in either an electronic and/or written format. (RCW 49.12.250)

To determine full-time employment, multiply

- Hourly wages by 2080
- Weekly wages by 52
- Bi-weekly wages by 26
- Semi-monthly wages by 24
- Monthly wages by 12

Example : If  Bobby's verification indicates he makes $14.00 an hour and works 40 hours per week, his projected income from wages would be:

$14.00 per hour x 2080 hours per year = $29,120 total annual income

Example: If Bobby's verification indicates he makes $1,250.00 bi -weekly, his projected income from wages would be:

$1,250.00 bi-weekly salary x 26 weeks = $32,500 total annual income

Example: If Bobby's verification indicates he makes $1,250.00 semi -monthly, his projected income from wages would be:

$1,250.00 semi-monthly x 24 = $30,000 total annual income

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Example: If Bobby's verification indicates a monthly salary of $2,000.00, his projected income from wages would be:

$2,000.00 monthly salary x 12 months = $24,000 total annual income

## Annual Salary

If the verification provides an annual salary, use the entire amount. Do not break it down into an hourly, weekly, or monthly amount.

Example: If  Bobby's verification indicates an annual salary of $45,000.00, the projected income from wages is:

$45,000.00 total annual income

## Part-time Employment

Multiple hourly wages by the number of anticipated hours

Example: If Bobby's verification indicates he makes $14.00 an hour and works 30 hours per week, his employment income would be:

$14.00 per hour x 30 hours per week x 52 weeks = $21,840 total annual income

## Overtime

If the employer has listed overtime on the employment verification, include this amount in the calculated total annual income.

Example: If Bobby's verification indicates he makes $14.00 an hour and works 40 hours per week, with 1 -6 hours of overtime per month at $21.00 per hour, his projected income from wages would be:

$14.00 per hour x 2080 hours per year = $29,120 hourly wage

$21.00 per hour x 6 hours' x 12 months = $1,512.00 overtime

$29,120.00 + $1,512.00 = $30,632.00 total annual income

## Tips

Individuals who work in the service industry earn tips, which are a form of income. If tips are reported on the income verification use the information provided by the employer to calculate the anticipated income.

If the employer does not include tips, for service industry jobs you will need to calculate an anticipated income based on the annual income. Anticipated income from tips is calculated by multiplying the annual income by 20%.

In addition, have the applicant/resident self-certify what they anticipate earning from tips for the next 12 months.

Use the higher of the two as income from tips.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

If the applicant/resident has been employed and filed a tax return, obtain a copy of the most recent signed tax return including Form 4137 to support the self-certification (tips are required to be reported to the IRS).

Example: If Bobby's verification indicates he makes $14.00 an hour, works 40 hours per week and earns $150.00 per week in tips, the projected income from wages would be:

$14.00 per hour x 2080 hours per year = $29,120.00 $150.00 per week x 52 per weeks = $7,800.00 $29,120.00 + $7,800.00 = $36,920.00 total annual income
```

## Raises

If  the  employment verification includes a raise that will occur within 12 months from the move-in or certification date, that raise must be included in the calculation of annual income.

Example : If Bobby's verification indicates he makes $14.00 an hour and works 40 hours per week, with 1 -2 hours of overtime per week at $21.00 per hour, and is scheduled to receive a $2.00 per hour raise on January 16 th with a move in date of November 1 st the projected income from wages would be:

* November 1 st -January 15 th

$14.00 per hour x 40 hours per week x 10 weeks = $5,600.00 hourly wage

$21.00 per hour x 2 hours per week x 10 weeks = $420.00 overtime

January 16 th

$16.00 per hour x 40 hours per week x 42 weeks = $26,880.00

$24.00 per hour x 2 hours per week x 42 weeks = $2,016.00

$5,600.00 + $420.00 + $26,880.00 + $2,016.00 = $34,916.00 total annual income

* To determine weeks from move-in or certification effective date to the date of increase, you will need to determine the weeks within this period by averaging the weeks.

November: 30 days; December: 31 days; January: 15 days.

Total weeks = 76 days / 7 number of days in a week = 10.857 average weeks

For this calculation, you will round down. The applicant/resident will have 10 weeks at the current rate and 42 weeks at the higher rate.

## Year to Date Calculation

In addition to calculating the projected income from wages, it is important to use the year-to-date income to project income based on actual income the applicant/resident has received. The year-to-date total often  times  includes  overtime,  bonuses,  tips,  commission  etc.  that  may  not  be  reflected  on  the verification.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

If the year-to-date total is not reflected on the employment verification, this information can be obtained from a recent pay stub.

Example: If  Bobby's verification indicates they received $4,513.57 in gross earnings for the period of December 18 th through February 14th you would calculate income as follows:

*First, determine the number of weeks from December 18 th -February 18. In this example, there are eight weeks.

$4,513.57 ytd / 9 weeks' x 52 weeks = $26,078.404444

In this calculation, the income would be rounded down for a total annual income of $26,078.40

* To determine the number of weeks for the period reflected in the year-to-date earnings:

December: 14 days; January: 31 days; February: 18 days.

Total weeks = 63 days / 7 number of days in a week = 9 weeks

For this calculation, you will round down. The applicant/resident will have 10 weeks at the current rate and 42 weeks at the higher rate.

## Seasonal, Temporary, or Sporadic Work

Individuals employed in seasonal work, such as landscaping, construction, farm work, tourism etc. may experience periods of no work due to weather or seasonal conditions etc. These individuals may also collect unemployment for the periods they are unemployed from their jobs. In determining the income, both forms of income should be used for the period received.

Regularly scheduled seasonal pay, add months of pay plus anticipated unemployment to projected 12 months of income.

For temporary or sporadic work, try to get a history of at least three years. Use the information provided to  make  a  reasonable  projection  of  anticipated  income.  Be  sure  to  include  unemployment  in  the projection if applicable.

Example: Cindy works as a tutor from September through April and files for unemployment when she is not working. Count eight months of employment income and four months of unemployment.

Example: If  John works as a temp, and during the last three-year period he worked intermittently for three temporary agencies, ask for the employment history from all three agencies. Consider his present circumstances and evaluate his history to make a reasonable projection of employment income. Please note that these employment projections can be very difficult. In this case, documentation of the facts is paramount.

## SELF-EMPLOYMENT INCOME

Obtain a signed copy of the prior year tax returns, including Schedule C and 1099 received to determine the net income from business.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

For current year, have the applicant/resident certify what he or she anticipates the next year's income to be. To support this information, obtain a copy of their current accounting records.

If anticipated income is significantly different from past income, have the applicant/resident document why in writing.

Example: David works as a janitor for four clients and last year his biggest client went out of business. His records indicated that he earned $18,000 in the past calendar year, but $10,000 of that income was from the client who is no longer in business. David hopes to make up some of the lost revenue with new clients. His best guess is that he can make up $3,000 by taking on additional clients.

$18,000.00 - $10,000.00 + $3,000.00 = $11,000.00 projected income

Example: Jody works as an events coordinator for five clients. Last year he earned $15,000 but this year one of his clients is anticipating a much busier calendar of events so Jody anticipates earning $21,000. Jody will provide written certification of his anticipated income along with the reason for the difference from last year.

For casual intermittent income (such as occasional babysitting, house cleaning, and/or lawn maintenance) have the applicant/ resident self-certify the anticipated income and frequency.

If the applicant/resident, has income from other sources, these must be verified and calculated based on the type of income to ensure all sources of employment and unemployment (if applicable) are included in the total income calculation.

## MILITARY PAY

When determining income for military personnel, there are several entitlements that must be included.

- Base Pay
- Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)
- Basic allowance for subsistence (BAS)
- Family Separation Allowance
- Clothing Allowance (CA)*
- Foreign Duty Pay (FDP)
- Special pay for assignments and fields
- o Sea Duty
- o Flight Duty
- o Submarine Duty
- o Explosives
- o Jumping

Do not include special pay to those serving in the Armed Forces who are exposed to hostile fire.

If the applicant/resident has received a one-time bonus, these are to be treated as an asset.

*Note, clothing allowance is an annual allowance.

The  monthly  entitlements  such  as  base  pay,  BAH  and  BAS,  are  reflected  on  the  leave  and  earning statements that the applicant/resident can provide.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Applicant/resident can obtain their statement from https://mypay.dfas.mil/#/.

A complete list of entitlements by pay grade can be found at:

https://www.dfas.mil/MilitaryMembers/payentitlements/Pay-Tables/Basic-Pay/EM/

To locate the current BAH by zip code visit:

https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/bahCalc.cfm

Example: Bobby is an enlisted member of the Armed Forces who has been serving for five years and is currently a E-4 with no dependents. The resident they are applying for is located in the zip code of 98504. Using the links above to confirm the entitled amounts based on his rank and years of service the following will need to be included as income:

- Base Pay = $2,634.60
- BAH = $1,386.00
- BAS = $372.71
- Clothing Allowance = $444.53

Monthly income = $2,634.60 + $1,386.00 + $372.71 = $4,393.31

Annual income = $4,393.31 x 12 months = $52,719.72 + 444.53 = $53,164.25

## UNEMPLOYMENT

Always  use  gross  amounts.  Unemployment  income  is  paid  weekly  and  should  always  be  annualized (weekly benefit amount times 52) unless employment income is projected for part of the year.

## Verification:

- Online statement
- Benefit letter
- Paystub from current check if gross amount is listed

Example: $201.00 x 52 weeks = $10,452.00 (no anticipated employment income)

Example: $201.00 x 26 weeks = $5,226.00 + projected employment income

Note: Applicants/residents can collect unemployment from states other than Washington while still living in Washington.

## RESIDENT SERVICES STIPENDS

Include as income the entire amount of the stipend if the stipend is greater than $200 a month. Exclude the entire amount of the stipend if the stipend is $200 or less.

## Verification:

- Property management statement/accounting records

Example: $200.00 per month x 12 months = $2,400.00 ( excluded -do not count as income)

Example: $201.00 per month x 12 months = $2,412.00 months (included -count entire amount)

## SOCIAL SECURITY, SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY, AND SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME

Always use the gross amount (before any deductions for Medicare, taxes, or garnishments) unless the payment is  being  reduced  the  by  the  Social  Security  Administration  for  prior  over-payment  of  Social Security benefits. Multiply the monthly amount by 12 to determine the projected annual income.

Be sure to verify and include Social Security/SSI income of all household members, including minors.

Verifications:

- Online Statement from My Social Security website
- Benefit letter no older than the last COLA letter for HTF units

COLA increases for Social Security are announced at the end of each year and will need to be included when calculating  the  next  12  months of  income.  To  establish  the  new  monthly  income,  multiply  the percentage of increase by the monthly benefit.

Hint: Do not accept Social Security benefit letters that list a 'you will receive' as this is the net amount, and income is calculated using gross income which may be different from the gross

Example: Bobby's verification reflects the gross amount of $1473.16 per month in social security and will receive  a  cost-of-living  allowance  of  3%  on  January  1 st . Bobby's  certification  date  is  November  1 st . Projected income from social security is:

November -December

$1,473.16 per month x 2 months = $2,946.32

January -October

$1,517.35 per month x 10 months = $15,173.50

Annual Income

$2,946.32 + $15,173.50 = $18,119.82 total annual income

Note:  Lump Sum Social Security payments are counted as assets not income. See Lump Sum section for guidance on Lump Sum amounts.

## PENSION INCOME

Use the gross amount of the pension income to determine annual income. Typically pension payments are received monthly; however, that can vary, so the frequency of payments will need to be determined.

When calculating income, use the gross amount multiplied by the frequency to determine annual income.

Note: For a government pension, if any portion of the pension is paid directly to a former spouse due to a court order, do not include that portion in annual income.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Do not count any Veterans Administration Aid &amp; Attendance income that is specifically for the cost of medical expenses for any family member.

Some pension income can be very difficult to verify. If a current benefit letter is not obtainable, have the applicant/resident self-certify the amount, frequency, any anticipated COLAS, and also provide a copy of the prior year's 1099 and most recent outdated benefit letter as backup.

## Verifications:

- Online statements
- Benefit letters no older than 12 months for HTF units

Example: $1,000.00 * 12 = $12,000.00

## CHILD SUPPORT AND ALIMONY

Child support can be paid monthly, weekly, sporadically, or not at all. Child support can come from more than one parent. Child support can be current payments and/or back payments. An applicant/resident might be receiving back child support even if the children are now grown and may not even be part of the household.

In cases where child support is sporadic or the amounts are inconsistent, make a reasonable projection of income based on the information available.

## Verification:

- Statement from the Office of Support Enforcement showing amounts paid.
- Documents of court ordered child support or alimony.
- If the applicant/resident is not receiving the court ordered amount, have the applicant/resident obtain a statement from the Office of Support Enforcement showing the amounts paid over the past year and have the applicant/resident self-certify that no child support is being received.
- If the child support is not court ordered, obtain a notarized statement from the person paying the support.  If  such  documentation  is  not  provided,  have  the  applicant/resident  self-certify  the amount he or she receives.

Example: (Stable payments) $50.00 * 52 = $2,600.00

Example: If payments are not stable, review 12 months of child support payments. Pay attention to any lump sum payments and make a reasonable projection of anticipated income.

## ANNUITIES

Always use the gross amount. Usually, annuity income is paid monthly. Determine the frequency of the annuity payments to determine the annual amount. Multiply a monthly benefit amount by 12.

## Verification:

- Annuity statement
- Benefit letter
- Written verification from the benefit provider

## Example: $1,000.00 monthly x 12 months = $12,000.00

## PUBLIC ASSISTANCE INCOME (ABD, TANF, STATE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT)

Include the total monthly income the applicant/resident is receiving. Do not include food assistances (AKA Food Stamps, SNAP) or Housing and Essential Needs (HEN) income.

## Verification:

- Printout from the DSHS Benefit Verification System (BVS)
- Benefit letters. Usually, public assistance income is paid monthly.

Example :  $197.00 per month x 12 months = $2,364.00 total annual income

## GIFT SUPPORT

Do not count groceries or payments made directly to childcare providers. In some circumstances, gift support may be provided by more than one source.

## Verification:

- Statement from provider(s) of support stating the amount, frequency, and purpose of gift(s).

Example:  For example, an aunt might provide $25 a week, and a grandparent might provide $75 a month.

$25.00 per week x 52 weeks = $1,300.00

$75.00 per month x 12 months = $900.00

$1,300.00 + $900.00 = $2,200.00 total annual income

## RENTAL INCOME

For rental income from property owned by the applicant/resident, request:

- IRS Form 1040 including Schedule E (unless it is a rental too recent to have been included on a tax return).
- Copy of lease.

Count the remaining balance after deducting the mortgage interest, taxes, insurance and other rental expenses as income.

Example: Billie  entered  into  a  lease  agreement  to  rent  the  property  for  $1,000.00  per  month.  Yearly mortgage interest is $4,000.00, insurance is 2,000.00 and other rental expenses total 1,000.00 for a total of $7,000.00.

Actual income: $12,000.00 - $7,000.00 = $5,000.00 rental income per year.

## STUDENT INCOME

Include the entire amount of unearned income received by any student in the household as part of the total household income.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

Include only the first $480.00 of earned income for any fulltime student who is 18 years or older and is a dependent.

Student financial assistance is counted if the household is receiving a Section 8 Project Based or Voucher Assistance. This form of income may be excluded if one of the following apply to the individual receiving the voucher:

- a) Individual is living with their parents, or
- b) Person is over the age of 23 with dependent children

Financial  assistance  includes  education  entitlements,  financial-aid  packages,  grants,  scholarships  and work study programs. Student loans are not included as income.

Verify Work Study as part of employment income. To verify the amount of tuition and required fees charged to the student obtain a copy of the student's bill or account statement.

To verify the amount of financial assistance received by the student obtain a copy of the FAFSA Award letter from the student.

Note: College and Universities typically have semesters or quarters. There are three semesters in a school year (including a summer semester) and four quarters in a school year (including a summer quarter). Determine if  the  institution  is  on  semesters  or  quarters  and  confirm  if  the  applicant/resident  will  be attending the summer term. Use this information when annualizing income financial assistance.

Example: Billie attends a university that is on semesters and does not plan on attending summer term. The total assistance received per term is $2,700.00 including $500.00 in student loans and $200.00 in Work Study. The total tuition and required fees per semester are $1,700.00.

$2,000.00 financial assistance x 2 terms = $4,000.00

$1,700.00 tuition and required fees x 2 terms =$3,400.00

Total amount included in annual income $600.00

Note: The amounts listed on the award letter for Student Loans and Work Study are not included in the calculation as student loans are never included and Work Study is treated as employment income.

## INCOME FROM ASSETS

Annual income includes amounts derived from assets to which family members have access.

Assets are items of value that may be turned into cash. A savings account is a cash asset. The bank pays interest on the asset. The interest is the income from that asset.

Cash is considered an asset regardless if it is held in a financial institution or not.

Some belongings of value are not considered assets. Necessary personal property is not counted as an asset includes, but not limited to clothing, T.V., computers, family vehicle, and wedding rings.

If assets are owned jointly, prorate the assets according to the percentage of ownership. If no percentage is  specified,  prorate  the  assets  evenly  among  all owners. If  somebody has access to another person's

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook account for the benefit of the other person, if the owner of the asset is not a member of the household, do not count it as an asset of the household.

Example:  Jane, Cindy, and Marsha have an account totaling $300,000. If no individual percentages are specified, divide the balance by three and multiply by the number of people in the household. If only Cindy is a household member, count $300,000 / 3 = $100,000 (asset).

## Savings account, Money Market, Certificates of Deposit

Look for interest rate and include interest income in projection.

## Verification:

- Statement no older than six months. Online statements are often available.
- Third-party verification from financial institution

Example: $447.37 (asset) and $447.37 * .01% = $0.04 (interest)

## Checking Account

Use the average balance for the last six months. Look for interest rate and include interest income in projection.

## Verification:

- Six months of recent, consecutive bank statements. Online statements are often available.
- Third-party verification from financial institution

Example: $12.00 (asset) and 12.00 * .01 = $0.00 (interest)

## Pre-paid Debit Cards

Some applicants/residents may have periodic payments loaded directly on a debit card. Social Security payments can be loaded onto a Direct Express debit card. Washington State DSHS payments can be loaded onto a Washington Quest debit card. Child support and unemployment payments can be loaded onto debit cards. Some employers will load employment income onto a debit card. Typically, no interest is paid on prepaid debit cards and money can be loaded only by the source of the payments.

Debit card balances are counted as assets.

## Verification:

- Printout of ATM debit card balance inquiry
- Online statement of account balance

Example: $477.00 (asset)

## Stocks

Determine cash value for each account and count as an asset.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

## Verification:

- Quarterly statements
- Third party verification from brokerage firm

Example: $6,371.22 (asset)

## Bonds

The bond calculator will often provide a total value of the bonds and interest if there are more than one bond.

## Verification:

- Bond  certificate. Check  to  see  if the bond(s)  can  be  verified  on the bond  calculator: https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/tools/tools\_savingsbondcalc.htm

Example: $867 (asset) and $17.34 (interest)

## Trusts

## Revocable Trust

Count as an asset. If the trust has a specific interest rate, use the interest rate to project interest income.

## Irrevocable Trust

Only count income that is distributed to the recipient.

## Special Needs Trusts

Pay special attention to the verbiage of the trust to determine income to the beneficiary.

If the beneficiary does not have access to income from the trust, do not include it when calculating income.

## Verification:

- Trust document and statement from trustee.

Example: Revocable trust with fixed interest rate:  $27,573.44 (asset) and $2,000 (interest)

Example: Irrevocable trust with regular payments:  $500 * 12 = $6,000 (trust income)

## Retirement Accounts (including IRAs, Simple IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, Roth IRAs)

If amounts are distributed on an annual basis or no amounts are distributed, count the retirement account as an asset.

If amounts are distributed more frequently than annually, count the distributed amounts as income.

If the applicant/resident has no access to the account, do not include it as an asset or income.

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

If the applicant/resident has access but would incur a penalty, determine the cash value (i.e., subtract 10% of the total value if the account holder is not at least 59 ½ years old).

Often retirement accounts do not have a fixed interest rate, so the only interest that would be calculated would be imputed interest if the total household assets exceed $5,000. Note:  Some IRAs are held at banks and do have fixed interest rates. If there is a fixed interest rate, calculate the interest and include as income from asset.

## Verification:

- Quarterly statements
- Third party verification from brokerage firm or financial institution

Example: $47,000.00 -$4,700 = $42,300 (asset)

## Life Insurance

Term policies have no cash value. Do not include in income calculations.

Whole  life,  investment  life,  or  universal  life ,  determine  cash  or  surrender  value;  surrender penalty is usually quite high just after purchase and gradually decreases during the life of the policy.

## Verification:

- Insurance policy
- Third-party verification from insurance provider

Example:  $100,000 - $27,000 = $73,000 (asset)

## Real Estate

Determine the cash value (market value less any costs that would be incurred to sell it, such as mortgage and/or Home Equity Lines of Credit balances, broker fees, etc.).

## Verification:

- Current tax assessed value (often available online)
- Recent appraisal
- Copy of listing agreement if property is for sale

Example:  $156,000 (market value) - $101,000 (mortgage) - $5,000 (commission) = $50,000 income from asset

## Mortgage or Deed of Trust

Count the principal amount as of the date of the certification as an asset and count the anticipated interest for the next 12 months as income.

## Verification:

- Copy of contract &amp; amortization schedule

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Third-party verification completed  by  accountant,  attorney,  real estate broker, financial institution, or buyer

Example:  $100,000 (income) and $7,200 (interest)

## Lump-Sum Payments

This  includes  including  one-time  lottery  payments,  Social  Security  retroactive  payments,  insurance proceeds, inheritances, and lawsuit settlements.

Review the verification documents to determine if the payout is truly a lump sum (one-time payment) or recurring payments.

Lottery winnings:  Count as an asset if winnings are claimed as a one-time payment. Count as income winnings that are claimed in regular payments.

A lump sum payment is counted as an asset only as long as the household member(s) continue to possess it. At the time of certification/recertification, count only the balance the household possesses. If the asset is being held in a financial institution, it will be verified through the bank verification process. If the asset is being held as cash, have the applicant/resident self-certify the value of the cash on hand.

## Verification of Income

- Lottery win statement
- Letter from estate executor or probate court
- Settlement statement
- Verification from attorney

Example: Lottery winnings are $1,000 a week:  $1,000 * 52 = $52,000 (income)

## Verification of Asset:

- Asset verification process
- Cash on hand self-certification

Example: $47,777.17 (asset)

## Assets Disposed of for Less than Fair Market Value

Count as an asset for two years from the date of the disposition.

## Verification:

- Self-certification from applicant/resident.

Example: Gifted $5,000 to grandson. Count $5,000 (asset) for two years from date of gift.

## Determining Income from Assets

When total household assets are more than $5,000, annual income includes the greater of the following:

- Actual income from assets, or

Washington State Housing Trust Fund Handbook

- Imputed income from assets. (The current passbook rate is .06%.)

Example: Add cash value of all assets. Multiply the total cash value of all assets by 0.06%. The product is the 'imputed income' from assets . Then add the actual income from all assets. Determine which is higher and include the higher amount as income from assets.

When total household assets are $5,000 or less, include the actual income from assets as income.

## NO INCOME

Any adult household member with no source of income should be asked to provide a written certification of no income and explanation of how rent and living expenses will be paid.

Example: Jerry is claiming no income but he is getting food assistance and has a housing voucher. His statement should state that he has no income, and he will use his food assistance to buy food and his housing voucher to pay the rent.

## EXEMPT INCOME

Commerce recognizes Federally Mandated Exclusions from Income (79 FR 28938) for its HTF program.

Exempt income should still be verified, and the verification will serve as an explanation of how rent and living expenses will be paid.

Only the income that is identified as exempt is not included in household income.

Example: John and Sally each have employment income. John's employment income is non-exempt, so it is  counted  in  the  household  income  calculations. Sally's  income  is  funded  under  Title  V  of  the  Older Americans Act of 1965. Both employment incomes will be verified. Sally's income will not be counted as household income for purposes of income qualification.

## RESIDENT FILES AND RECORD RETENTION

Files are required to be maintained for each household that occupies a Housing Trust Fund assisted unit. These  files  should  include  all  documents  used  to  qualify  the  household,  lease  documents  and  any additional information the household is required to complete to occupy the unit. This information will need to be available to Compliance Asset Managers during onsite monitoring visits.

Refer to Section 501.4.2 On-Site Document Monitoring for additional information that will be reviewed during an Onsite inspection.

Records, including all active and inactive resident files, are required to be retained for six (6) years beyond the end of the commitment period or last audit; whichever is later. Please note, contracts may contain different language if this is the case, follow the contract.

## GLOSSARY

Administrative Costs. The cost of salaries, wages and related costs for eligible HTF applicants. Such costs are organizational rather than project-related and are not eligible for reimbursement with HTF capital bond proceeds.

Adaptive Reuse. The alteration of an existing site or building to provide housing, when the previous purpose of the site or building was something other than housing. The conversion of a hospital into apartments is an example.

Adult Family Homes: As defined under RCW 70.128.

Affordability. Affordability is achieved when a household's rent and utility costs (other than telephone) do not exceed 30 percent of the monthly income for the targeted income group as adjusted for household  size.  In  the  context  of  homeownership,  affordability  occurs  w hen  a  household's monthly housing costs are generally no more than 38% of monthly household income and total debt  is  no  more  than  45%  of  monthly  household  income.  Housing  costs  include  mortgage principal, interest, property taxes, homeowner insurance, homeowner association fees, and land lease fees, as applicable.

Tiny Shelter. A structure intended for time-limited residency, which does not fully comply with the Washington State Department of Labor &amp; Industries' definition of a Tiny House due to it lacking the amenities of a single dwelling unit (no kitchen/food preparation space and/or no bathroom). The structure may or may not be on a foundation. Washington State Building Code will be required when supplemental standards are adopted.

- Title. Evidence of legal ownership interest in a property and the right to encumber the property (e.g., to borrow funds, which will be secured by a loan against the property).
- Total Development Cost (TDC). The sum of project development costs noted on a project development budget. Such costs will include building/land acquisition and construction / rehabilitation hard and soft costs (i.e. development and other development costs noted on the HTF development budgets). Residential and non-residential TDCs may be noted in the HTF applications.

Transitional Housing. Developments offering intermediate term temporary residency ranging from two months to two years. Social services are typically included in this kind of development.
