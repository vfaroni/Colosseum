## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Member of Fir Tree Park Apartments (A Segment of Riverside Charitable Corporation)

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Fir Tree Park Apartments, which comprise the statements of financial position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statements of activities, changes in changes in net assets, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fir Tree Park Apartments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of  America.  Our  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of Fir Tree Park Apartments and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

## Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,  implementation,  and  maintenance  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  is  required  to  evaluate  whether  there  are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Fir Tree Park Apartments' ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that  includes  our  opinion. Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance  but  is  not  absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud  may involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal  control.  Misstatements  are  considered  material  if  there  is  a  substantial  likelihood  that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:

-  Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
-  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
-  Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Fir Tree Park Apartments' internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
-  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
-  Conclude  whether,  in  our  judgment,  there  are  conditions  or  events,  considered  in  the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Fir Tree Park Apartments' ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

## Supplementary Information

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The supplementary information is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit  of  the financial  statements  and  certain  additional  procedures,  including  comparing  and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023

## NOTE 1-ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## ORGANIZATION

Fir Tree Park Apartments (the Property) is a 60-unit senior housing apartment complex located in Shelton, Washington. Legal title to the Property was held by Community Housing Assistance Program,  Inc.  (CHAPA).  CHAPA  was  organized  on  May  29,  1992  under  the  Public-benefit Nonprofit Corporation law for charitable purposes.

CHAPA purchased the Property on November 17, 2003. In January 2023, CHAPA assigned its interest in the Property to Riverside Charitable Corporation (RCC), a California nonprofit public benefit corporation that shares common board members with CHAPA and was organized in 1988 under the Public-benefit Nonprofit Corporation law for charitable purposes.  The accompanying financial statements reflect only the accounts of the Property and do not represent the financial position, changes in net assets and cash flows of the owner, RCC.

The Property has entered into a housing assistance payment contract (HAP Contract) with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

The HAP Contract is a rent assistance program for low-income families (or persons) as provided by the Section 8 Program of Title II of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1937.  Eligible low-income residents pay 30% of their income as rent, while HUD pays the difference between this rental amount and contract rent, as defined.  The Property can request from HUD an amount equal to 80% of contract rent during periods that the unit is vacant if certain conditions are met, but not to exceed 60 days.  If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period, the Property may submit a claim and receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis if certain conditions are met as outlined in the HAP Contract.

The HAP Contract, among other items, prohibits the sale, assignment, conveyance or transfer of the HAP Contract on all or any part of the Property without the prior consent of HUD.

## SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## Basis of preparation of the financial statements

The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accounting principles generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  include  Accounting  Standards  Codifications (ASC) or Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) as further described.

The financial statements are in conformity with the provisions required by the Not-for-Profit Entities Presentation  of  Financial  Statements  topic  of  FASB ASC 958-205.    This  statement  established standards for external financial reporting for Not-for-Profit Organizations.

The Not-for-Profit Entities Presentation of Financial Statements topic of the FASB ASC primarily affects the display of the financial statements and requires that the amounts for each of two classes of net assets - with or without donor restrictions be displayed in an aggregate statement of financial position  and  the  amounts  of  change  in  each  of  those  classes  of  net  assets  be  displayed  in  a statement of changes in net assets - without donor restrictions.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023

All assets held by the Property at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are classified as without donor restrictions.

The financial statements report certain categories of expenses that are attributable to one or more programs or supporting services of the Property.  All revenue and expenses relates to the operating costs of the multi-family Property except for administrative expenses in the statements of activities are deemed program expenses.  All administrative expenses represent supporting services.

## Cash

The Property considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash consists of an unrestricted checking account and petty cash.

## Rental income

Rental  income  is  recognized  as  rents  become  due.    Rental  payments  received  in  advance  are deferred  until  earned.    All  leases  between  the  Property  and  the  residents  of  the  Property  are operating leases under FASB ASC 842 and are not within the scope of FASB ASU 2014-09.

## Resident receivable and bad debt policy

Resident rent charges for the current month are due on the first of the month.  Residents who are evicted  or  move-out  are  charged  with  damages  and/or  cleaning  fees,  if  applicable.    Resident receivables consist of amounts due for rental income or the charges for damages and/or cleaning fees.  The Property does not accrue interest on the resident receivable balances.

Resident receivables are charged to bad debt expense when they are determined to be uncollectible based upon a periodic review of the accounts by management. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the allowance method be used to recognize bad debts; however, the effect of using the direct write-off method is not material to the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, bad debts expensed totaled $0 and $0, respectively.

## Property and equipment

Building and improvements, land improvements and furniture and equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 27.5-40, 15-20 and 5-7 years, respectively, using the straightline method for the financial statements. The Property is held for sale as of December 2, 2024 and has ceased recognizing depreciation (see Note 6).

The Property is subject to the provisions of the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets topic of the FASB ASC 360-10.  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets has no retroactive impact on the Property's financial statements.  The standard requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets (excluding interest) are less than the carrying amount of the assets.  In such cases, the carrying value of assets to be held and used are adjusted to their estimated fair value and assets held for sale are adjusted to their estimated fair value less selling expenses.  No impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023

## Debt issuance costs

The Property is subject to the provisions of the Interest-Imputation of Interest topic of the FASB ASC 835-30 which requires unamortized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction of the outstanding debt and the amortization of the debt issuance costs to be presented as a component of  interest  expense.  Generally  accepted  accounting  principles  require  that  the  effective  yield method be used to amortize debt issuance costs; however, the effect of using the straight-line method is not material to the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## Advertising costs

Advertising  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  are  included  in  administrative  expenses  in  the statements of activities.

## Property taxes

The Washington State Department of Revenue granted an exemption from real estate taxes for the Property.  In  order  to  continue  to  qualify  for  these  exemptions,  the  owner  must  provide documentation of certain resident eligibility requirements and file for the exemption on an annual basis.

## Concentration of credit risk

The Property deposits its cash in federally insured financial institutions.  At times, deposits may exceed Federal insurance limits.  The Property has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

The Property's operations are concentrated in the multifamily real estate market.  In addition, the Property operates in a heavily regulated environment.  The operations of the Property are subject to  the  administrative  directives,  rules  and  regulations  of federal,  state  and  local  regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, HUD. Such administrative directives, rules and regulations are subject to change by an act of Congress or an administrative change mandated by HUD.  Such changes may occur with little notice or inadequate funding to pay for the related cost, including the additional administrative burden, if any, to comply with a change.

## Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023

## Fair value

The Property is subject to the provisions of the Fair Value Measurement topic of the FASB ASC 820-10 which provides guidance for assets and liabilities which are required to be measured at fair value  and  requires  expanded  disclosure  for  fair  value  measurement.  The  standard  applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not require any new fair value measurements. The implementation of Fair Value Measurement did not have a material impact on the Property's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes

The  Property  is  a  wholly  owned  segment  of  RCC,  a  tax-exempt  organization.    As  such,  these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Property has no other tax positions which it must consider for disclosure. There has been no interest of penalties recognized in the statements or activities of financial position for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Generally, RCC's returns are subject to examination for three years after the later of the original or extended due date or the date filed with the applicable tax authorities.

## Subsequent events

Management performed an evaluation of the Property's activity through March 31, 2025, the audit report date, and has concluded that there are no significant subsequent events requiring disclosure through the date these financial statements were available to be issued, except as noted in Note 6.

## NOTE 2-FINANCING

## Notes payable

RCC (assigned from CHAPA) obtained loans from the Department of Community, Trade, and Economic Development Housing Trust Fund (HTF) in the total amount of $950,000.  The proceeds from these loans were used to finance the acquisitions of the Property.
