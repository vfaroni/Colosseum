## IMPLICATIONS FOR ACQUISITION

### Positive Factors
1. **$950,000 converts to grant** - No repayment if compliance maintained
2. **40-year affordability period** aligns with long-term mission
3. **Senior housing requirement** matches current use
4. **0% interest on HTF portion** ($750,000)

### Risk Factors
1. **Sale triggers repayment** plus share of appreciation
2. **Must maintain senior housing** (62+) designation
3. **Income restrictions** must be maintained
4. **Annual compliance reporting** required

### Questions for Seller (RCC)
1. Are there ADDITIONAL repair funds allocated beyond the $950,000?
2. Has any of the $950,000 been drawn for repairs already?
3. Are there pending applications for additional HTF/HOME funds?
4. What is the exact forgiveness date (40 years from when)?
5. Are there any compliance violations or concerns?

## RECOMMENDATION

The HTF/HOME structure is FAVORABLE for acquisition:
- Essentially $950,000 in free equity if held for full term
- Low cost of capital (0% on $750k, 1% on $200k)
- BUT need clarity on additional repair fund allocations mentioned by RCC

**CRITICAL**: Confirm if there are SEPARATE repair allocations beyond the acquisition loans.
