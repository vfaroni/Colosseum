## Capital Needs Assessment

Project: Fir Tree Apartments/Shelton, WA

Date: 5-11-2021

## Capital Needs Summary

The Fir Tree Apartments are a 60-unit senior apartment facility located in Shelton, WA. The property is within 4 blocks of the downtown Shelton business district. There are sidewalks and pathways that enable the tenants to walk to close shopping areas and public transportation is also available. The apartments consist of six separate buildings. All buildings are 2-story wood framed structures with one-bedroom/one-bathroom units. The up-stair units are accessed by an exterior stairway, which is shared by two up-stair units at each stairway. There are no patios or decks attached to the units. However, the property has adequate site landscaping with site benches, picnic tables and walkways. In addition, there is a section provided to the tenants for gardens.

The property is connected to the local sanitary and storm sewer system. There is no natural gas on site. The sewer usage, water usage, power usage and waste disposal are paid for by the property. The units have individual electrical meters, individual water shut-offs and individual feeds for data and TV cabling. The site manager and the maintenance supervisor was interviewed during this inspection in order to obtain additional information related to maintenance schedules, replaced equipment and/or furnishings at unit turn, typical equipment and fixture failures, etc. Various tenants were interviewed for additional information on use and conditions of the property. There were no drawings of the property provided for the inspection.

This report is based on the physical inspection of the property, which was conducted on May 11 th , 2021. The inspection is based on a 'AS-IS' type assessment to determine the current condition of the building and the furnishings within the apartments. All items inspected are assessed for their expected useful life (EUL) and their remaining useful life (RUL). The specific inspections are then listed into four main categories, which include Site, Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical and Dwelling Units. The objective of the assessment is to determine the anticipated costs for replacement, repair or maintaining these items during the next current 20-year term. The assessment notes the EUL and the RUL for each item. The cost is then stated if the item's RUL falls in the twenty-year time frame of the current term. The assessed EUL/RUL for each item is based on historic records, average EUL for similar items, quality of the specific item, location of the item and the anticipated use/tenant use of the item. The EUL/RUL for each item assessed can vary due to these factors. All items scheduled for replacement should be evaluated prior to initiating the actual replacement.

The assessment was conducted by an individual trained and experienced in evaluating building construction components, the value for replacement and/or repair of building construction elements and all accessibility requirements that fall under the ADA, HUD, UFAS, ANSI and Fair Housing guidelines along with the current IBC standards.

The projected Capital Needs over the 20-year term breaks down as follows:

Total current dollars for the term

$ 2,215,226

Total current dollars per unit

$ 36,920

Total inflated dollars (3%) for the term

$ 2,544,965

Total inflated dollars (3%) for the term/per unit

$ 42,416

Total dollars for Year 1

$ 640,741

## Capital Needs Assessment

Project: Fir Tree Apartments/Shelton, WA

## In order to fully execute the dollars for the assessment, taking the inflation factor into account, the total dollar amount needed is approx. $2,120.80 per unit per year .

The following items were reviewed during the inspection:

- ï‚· Unit interiors for the existing conditions, including bathrooms, bathroom equipment/fixtures, lighting, GFI protection at baths and kitchens, finished flooring, wall and ceiling finishes, doors and hardware, exhaust ventilation, kitchen and bath cabinets and countertops, plumbing fixtures/faucets, window coverings, exterior unit doors, hot water tanks, unit electrical panels and any obvious signs of structural or architectural failures.
- ï‚· Exteriors of the building for the existing conditions of decks, siding and siding components, windows, roofing, rails, stairways, foundations, exhaust termination at the exterior, attic spaces, drainage at footprint and concrete at the building perimeters.
- ï‚· Site conditions including the parking lot spaces, curbs, sidewalks, access paths, mailboxes, signage, site lighting, landscaping, trash enclosures, site fencing, site drainage, asphalt condition/failures, storm system, etc.
- ï‚· Common areas including the common laundry, maintenance storage, office, common bathrooms, common community room and general pathways.
- ï‚· All accessibility requirements related to current national and local codes.

Based on the properties age (49 years), there are specific items that will need replacement/repair within the twenty-year term. However, some items may exceed the standard EUL/RUL timeframes but have, in the opinion of this CNA Provider, some additional life as far as useful to this property. These specific items may be noted in the worksheet when that determination is made. No item exceeds an additional 25% of the Expected Useful Life standards as set forth by Fannie Mae and other national sources that provide such standards for use in property evaluations.

## Health and Safety

- 1) The stairways to the upper units have treads that are not equal in height. This is a trip hazard and should be addressed as soon as possible. The Architectural section of this assessment accounts for replacement of the treads to correct this safety issue. Closed riser type pre-cast treads are recommended in the replacement process.
- 2) Almost all of the bathrooms and kitchens inspected do not have protected GFCI receptacles installed. These are scheduled to be replaced in Years 1 and 15 as a life/safety issue and to comply with current code. When replaced, the devices need to meet arc fault protection due to the amendment of the NEC 2015.
- 3) No signs of mold were observed during the site inspection.
- 4) There were no signs of rodent infestation during the inspection.
- 5) Information in relation to a Phase 1 study for environmental concerns was not available to the Provider. WA State maps indicate that Radon levels in this region fall way below the Federal Standards. A Phase 1 report is recommended prior to any rehabilitation of the property. Asbestos and lead would be a concern based on the completion of the building in 1972.

## Site

The site for the property is a fairly level lot. There are numerous tall fir trees throughout the property as well as additional smaller hardwood type trees. The grounds are fully landscaped with large lawn areas between the buildings and plant areas adjacent to the buildings. The grounds are well maintained. The trees on the property should be pruned as many branches conflict with the roofs and siding. The cost of this is shown in the site assessment and is scheduled for every 10 years.

The property sidewalks have several damaged segments that need replacement in Year 1. There are other sections, along with existing ramps and short stairways, that need specific replacement. The ramp replacement would be needed for accessibility compliance. The existing concrete ramp sections exceed 8.3%, which is the maximum slope for an access ramp based on the ADA requirements. These are shown being replaced in the spreadsheet. The handrails for the stairs and ramps will, in addition, need replacement as well. They currently have weather related rust at critical sections and do not meet current code requirements.

The south, east and north parking lots are all in fair to good condition. They should have a seal coat applied every eight years for maintaining the EUL. The seal coat is shown spread over 2 years. This is also shown every 8 years. The cost for re-striping the parking lots after the seal coat is in the assessment. The assessment indicates a 5% accessibility valuation, which translates to three of the sixty units. In this anticipated requirement, the three parking spaces that would be designated and marked as accessible parking stalls need to be adjacent to the related unit. This cost is allocated in the assessment.

The exterior stairways are shown to have the treads replaced within the existing structures. The current treads are 46 years old and are not spaced according to code. They currently are a serious tripping hazard, as indicated in the Health and Safety section of this assessment.

The cost to change out the 24 existing light fixtures that are mounted on the site poles is included. The trash enclosures (4) are in fair to good condition. These are shown to have an approx. 10 years of RUL. These could be replaced as needed by Year 10.

An allowance for landscaping/tree pruning is shown in 10-year periods. The large trees on the west side will need pruning during the term.

## Architectural

All buildings on this property are wood framed structures over concrete foundation walls. All building are two stories, over crawl spaces that have recently been cleaned and protected. All building roofs are framed with 2 slopes, gable ends and asphalt shingle roofing. The windows for the property are all extruded vinyl. These typically have an expected useful life of 30 years. All windows should inspected and re-caulked as necessary every 10 years.  Each unit has an exterior entry door, with screen storm doors.

The buildings are wood framed structures with a short crawl space under the wood floors on shallow concrete footings. The roof is wood framed trusses with Â½' plywood under composition asphalt shingles. The roof shingles appear to have approx. five more years of RUL. The roofs are shown as replaced in Years 5-7. The replacement of the gutters and downspouts is shown in coordination with the adjacent roof replacement and at the same time sequence. The roof framing forms a full attic space above the upper units. This space was recently re-insulated by the local Utility Company via an energy conservation program. There appears to be adequate ventilation in the attic spaces. The ventilation is a flow through type using the soffit vents at the bottom and the ridge vent at the top. All

kitchen and bathroom vents extend up through the attic space and terminate at the exterior surface of the roof.

The siding for most of the property needs replacement.  The existing siding has numerous signs of weather damage. This is included in the assessment along with windows and doors. This will form a complete new weather-barrier for the buildings. The windows for the property are mainly extruded vinyl. These typically have an expected useful life of 30 years. These will need to be replaced during the siding replacement to ensure that the building envelope will function for the next 25 plus years. Any caulking at the perimeter of the windows is a secondary waterproofing as the windows have self-adhered membrane flashings. The perimeter caulking would be inspected and/or replaced in Year 10 during the re-caulking scope. The cost is included in the assessment.

The common area doors are scheduled for replacement. These need to have the proper weather seals and exterior hardware rated for weather.  It is recommended that all replaced exterior doors that are subject to weather have a rough opening that is flashed to integrate the siding and WRB components. Extended head flashing for those doors is also recommended. The unit entry doors are all under building cover. The existing doors are shown as replaced due to their EUL and the current conditions. New insulated/weather sealed units are included.

The mailboxes for the tenants are located under the stairs for each adjacent unit. These are included in assessment for replacement.

The exterior building mounted lights have a EUL of 25 years. Replacement of the fixtures is recommended due to the RUL of the existing. All light fixtures need to be Energy Star certified. The fixtures on the site poles are also shown as replaced. Energy Star fixtures are required.

A Building has a second section that houses the site Community Room, common kitchen, common bathroom and common laundry. The flooring in these areas is shown on the assessment as replaced. The hot water tank for the common bath and kitchen was recently replaced.

## Mechanical and Electric

The existing water piping is galvanized pipe. Due to the age of the pipe, corrosion is forming major blockage to the system. Water pressure is impacted in many units. The galvanized pipe needs to be replaced with a pex-type flexible piping. This has already been completed in 4 of the apartment units. The crawl space will enable this replacement with minimal wall repair in most units. The cost for the replacement is shown in the assessment along with a cost value for the wall repair. Both assessed costs are an educated guess at best. Three separate bids are recommended to obtain the real cost for this work.

There is no way to fix the existing water pressure at the tub/showers when the pipes are failing. These tubs need to be replaced during the water pipe replacement so access to the piping can be achieved. The tubs are beyond their EUL. The bathroom sinks are currently wall hung sinks. The assessment shows new bath cabinets with a countertop, faucet and sink replacement. A new toilet is scheduled for all 60 units.

The domestic hot water for the units is heated by a 50-gallon electric hot water tank. There is one 50-gallon tank for every four units. These are located in the closet of a downstairs unit. Future improvement should think about adding more tanks to properly provide the hot water needs for the tenants.

There is an individual electrical panel in each unit. These appear to be 60-100amp service panels. These have reached their EUL and should be replaced. A cost is shown for replacement of the panel and breakers.

The fire extinguishers are shown as replaced. These are installed at the upper and lower stair entries at each building.

## Dwellings

The unit interior wall and ceiling surfaces appear to be in good shape.  There will be some minor repairs needed throughout the property. This cost should be covered in operations as it is related to various maintenance issues and minor tenant damage.  Painting the unit interiors is shown every 10 years. Some units may require additional paint based on the tenant population and will more than likely be painted as units are turned over to new tenants.

The interior doors will typically last 20-25 years. Replacement is noted due to the age of the items. Closet doors are also replaced.  Kitchen cabinets and bath vanity cabinets are shown as replaced. Some of the existing bathrooms do not currently have vanity cabinets. There are a few units noted where the kitchen and bath cabinets were recently replaced. These can be replaced based on the RUL indicated. All cabinets and countertops need to meet the ESDS standards for low formaldehyde.

All fixtures in the bathrooms are scheduled for replacement. All fixtures need to meet the 'Water Saver' labeled requirements. The fixture replacement should be coordinated with the water piping replacement, as noted previously. The kitchen sink and faucet replacement, as shown, need to be coordinated with the countertop replacements.

All light fixtures have been replaced by a local energy conservation program. The bathroom fans have all been replaced within the same program.  Therefore, those items should make it through the next 20-year term without the need for replacement. All fans appear to be vented to the exterior. The kitchen fan is a wall mounted unit. It is original equipment and is scheduled for replacement. This unit needs to meet the Energy Star requirements. This is critical to the living environment within the interior. GFCI protected electrical receptacles are scheduled to replace the existing receptacles in the kitchen and bathroom areas.  In addition, these outlets need to be arc-fault protected due to current electrical code requirements. The unit smoke detectors have approx. a twelve-year lifespan. These are a life safety requirement. An additional smoke detector needs to be installed in each bedroom. The existing detector in the main entry should be replaced and should communicate with the bedroom detector per code. The units use electric baseboard heaters as their source of heat. These are scheduled for replacement due to their RUL status.

The units have one 13-cf refrigerator, one 4-burner 20' wide electric stove and one garbage disposal. All of these items are included for replacement in the assessment.   The refrigerator needs to have an Energy Star label for compliance with the Evergreen Standards.

The living rooms, hallway and bedrooms all have carpet with pad for flooring. Some units have had carpet replaced within the last 5 years. The carpet has an approx. 12-year lifespan. All existing carpet is included in the assessment. The remaining carpet is shown as replaced based on the EUL standard. A few of the bathroom and kitchen floors have been recently replaced. The remaining vinyl floors are indicated as replaced.

Window blinds are suggested to be replaced as needed. The cost included accounts for one replacement of each window blind.

## Accessibility

The property currently has two units with marginal accessibility. The property should base 5% of the total unit count as accessible. This includes the unit

interiors, the entry doorway, the stairs and handrails, the pathway from the unit to the adjacent parking, all common areas including mail delivery, trash enclosures, office, common rooms and access to the public street.

The current status of the property does not comply with the current national and local accessible guidelines. The assessment includes the follow costs and recommendations for accessibility modifications:

- 1) Modify three units to 100% accessibility. Each unit should be directly adjacent to the closest parking stall.
- 2) Move the bathroom wall into the bedroom closet (12'+-) to allow a 60' required turn-around for wheelchairs.
- 3) Replace the existing tub/showers with a transfer type shower.
- 4) Replace the toilet with an ADA rated toilet.
- 5) Add grab bars at the toilet and shower.
- 6) Widen doorways to all a 34' clearance minimum.
- 7) Units need to be ones at ground level for access.
- 8) Replacement of the kitchen cabinets to allow accessible cabinet configuration at the kitchen sink and service counter.
- 9) Move the kitchen wall into the living room area (12+-) to allow a 60' wheelchair turn-around.
- 10) Verify that the pathway, from the designated units to parking and all common areas, is compliant with all accessibility requirements regarding max. slope, clearance distances, adequate turning space, etc.
- 11) Some jurisdiction can require added horn/strobe fire alarms for the visually and hearing-impaired tenant.

It is recommended the Ownership engages a professional experienced in the accessibility standards and requirements for this jurisdiction as well as any requirements from additional related sources such as HUD, UFAS, ADA, Fair Housing, etc. prior to modifying the property in regards to accessibility.

## Environmental

- ï‚· Lead/Asbestos - The property was completed in 1972. It is assumed that lead or asbestos containing materials were used in the construction of the ï‚· property. A Phase 1 study should be consulted with to make that determination prior to any work proceeding.
- ï‚· Mold/Mildew - There were no signs of mold visible during the site inspection. Maintaining the whole house unit fans is critical in eliminating the

## How Replacement Costs Are Determined

The replacement costs used in this assessment were based on a combination and averaging of the following criteria:

- ï‚· Cost data from RS Means Residential Cost Data and Residential Repair and Remodeling Costs (2021- based on the northwest region).
- ï‚· Cost data from Rochlin Construction Services historical data base for rehab work in Washington State-specifically the Northwest sector.
- ï‚· Cost data from recent (2018-2021) USDA-RD/HUD/WA State rehabilitation projects using real subcontractor unit costs relative to a competitive bid process.

The objective of this assessment, as previously noted, is to provide the property Owner the realistic capital needed to keep this property functional and safe during the next 20- year term.  All assessments and recommendations were based on replacement or repair of a like for like material, fixture or equipment as a base line. Based on the age of the property, 49 years, several items scheduled for replacement would be upgraded for compliance to current code, current accessibility requirements and energy savings.   Overall performance, where budget allows a performance upgrade to offset future operating costs, is also a concern. The EUL is the listed time frames of the Expected Useful Life Table, as published by Fannie Mae for use in evaluating residential property assessments. Other national standards are used in conjunction with the Fannie Mae listings to develop an industry average time frame. The actual time frames are based on tenant use and location of specific items. Common area items may have more use and/or wear than dwelling unit items. Sometimes the reverse is true.

## Recommendations

Replacement time frames, as listed throughout this assessment are anticipated using industry averages, based on the quality of the item and by the anticipated tenant population use. It is recommended that an additional evaluation of each item/furnishing is done prior to the replacement time frames shown in this assessment. This is particularly crucial when replacements of major components ( roofs, HVAC equipment, electrical or mechanical systems) are scheduled for replacement. All costs shown in the assessment include the cost of the material/item and the cost for the installation. Taxes, General Conditions, insurance, etc. are not included.
