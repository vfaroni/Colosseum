CONDITION RATING STANDARDIZATION:
- "Excellent", "Superior", "Like New", "New" → "Excellent"
- "Good", "Well Maintained", "Above Average", "Satisfactory" → "Good"
- "Fair", "Average", "Adequate", "Typical" → "Fair"
- "Poor", "Below Average", "Needs Work", "Deteriorated" → "Poor"
- If no clear rating, use "Unknown"

FINANCIAL DATA HANDLING:
- Remove all currency symbols and commas
- Convert ranges to midpoint values
- Handle "per unit" and "per sqft" calculations
- Verify mathematical relationships (land + improvement = total)
- Express percentages as decimals

IMPROVEMENT PRIORITY LEVELS:
- "Critical", "Immediate", "Emergency" → "Critical"
- "High", "Important", "Soon" → "High"
- "Medium", "Moderate", "Recommended" → "Medium"
- "Low", "Optional", "Future" → "Low"

SPECIAL HANDLING:
- For age-related information, calculate from construction date if needed
- Handle "approximately" or "circa" figures by extracting the stated number
- For condition assessments, prioritize inspector's professional opinion
- Extract both current condition and recommended improvements
- Include timeline recommendations for major repairs
- Handle multi-building properties by aggregating or noting separately

MEASUREMENT CONVERSIONS:
- Keep measurements in original units (sq ft, acres, etc.)
- For lot sizes, note if in acres vs square feet
- Handle both metric and imperial units if present
- Maintain precision for financial calculations
