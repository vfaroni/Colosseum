EXTRACTION QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Prioritize financial data accuracy above all else
- For unit counts, ensure numbers add up correctly
- For financial ratios, verify calculations when possible
- Use consistent units (annual amounts, not monthly unless specified)
- Maintain precision in percentages and rates
- Cross-reference data points for consistency

SPECIAL HANDLING:
- If T-12 data is shown, use the most recent 12-month figures
- If pro forma projections are shown, clearly distinguish from actual figures
- For ranges (e.g., "5.5% - 6.0% cap rate"), use the midpoint
- For "approximately" or "circa" figures, extract the stated number
- For footnoted or asterisked figures, include the base number
