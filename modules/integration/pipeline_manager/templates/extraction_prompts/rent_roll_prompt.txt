EXTRACTION QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Verify unit counts match between summary and detailed data
- Cross-check occupancy calculations (occupied/total = occupancy rate)
- Ensure rent totals reconcile across different sections
- Validate lease expiration counts against unit data
- Check that unit types are consistently categorized
- Confirm financial calculations are mathematically correct

UNIT STATUS STANDARDIZATION:
- "Occupied", "Rented", "Current" → "Occupied"
- "Vacant", "Available", "Empty" → "Vacant"
- "Notice", "30 Day", "60 Day", "Moving" → "Notice"
- "Maintenance", "Make Ready", "Renovation" → "Maintenance"
- "Model", "Office", "Leasing" → "Model"
- "Employee", "Manager", "Staff" → "Employee"

DATE HANDLING:
- Accept various date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, MM-DD-YY, etc.)
- Extract dates as strings in original format
- Handle ranges like "01/15/24 - 01/14/25" for lease terms

SPECIAL HANDLING:
- If multiple rent roll dates are shown, use the most recent
- For vacant units, tenant_name should be null (not "Vacant")
- Handle partial months and prorated rents appropriately
- Extract both current and market rents if both are shown
- Include any special lease terms or concessions in notes
- Handle corporate/company names differently from individual names

UNIT TYPE MAPPING:
- "Studio", "Efficiency", "0BR" → "Studio"
- "1BR", "One Bedroom", "1 Bed" → "1BR"
- "2BR", "Two Bedroom", "2 Bed" → "2BR"
- "3BR", "Three Bedroom", "3 Bed" → "3BR"
- "4BR+", "Four+ Bedroom" → "4BR+"
