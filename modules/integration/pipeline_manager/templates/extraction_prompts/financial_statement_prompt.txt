EXTRACTION QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Verify mathematical consistency (income - expenses = NOI)
- Cross-check ratios and percentages for accuracy
- Ensure period consistency (annual vs monthly figures)
- Validate that percentages convert correctly to decimals
- Check unit counts match occupancy calculations
- Confirm debt service ratios are reasonable

SPECIAL HANDLING:
- If T-12 (trailing 12 months) data is shown, prioritize this over other periods
- For YTD figures, extract as-is but note the period type
- If both actual and budget figures are shown, extract both
- For interim statements, ensure period is correctly identified
- If multiple properties are consolidated, extract totals
- Handle negative numbers correctly (losses, negative cash flow)

PERIOD IDENTIFICATION GUIDE:
- "Annual" or "Year Ended" = annual
- "Quarterly" or "Quarter Ended" = quarterly  
- "Monthly" or "Month Ended" = monthly
- "Year to Date" or "YTD" = ytd
- "Trailing 12" or "T-12" = t12
