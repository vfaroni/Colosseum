## üìä CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

### **üèÜ MAJOR CORRECTION: Competition Analysis**
**Previous (Emergency)**: 22/38 sites fatal flaws (58% failure rate)  
**CORRECTED (Proper Rules)**: 10/38 sites fatal flaws (26.3% failure rate)  
**Net Improvement**: **12 additional sites** now suitable for 9% credits

**Root Cause of Original Error**: 
- Applied all historical LIHTC projects instead of 3-year lookback
- Missed county population exemptions (<1M population)
- Used wrong distance measurement criteria

### **üåä FLOOD ANALYSIS BREAKTHROUGH**  
**Coverage Achieved**: 100.0% (38/38 sites)
- **Zone X (Low Risk)**: 25+ sites - No flood insurance required
- **Zone AE/A (High Risk)**: 7 sites - Flood insurance required  
- **Data Sources**: Metro counties + regional datasets successfully integrated

**Root Cause of Previous Failures**: 
- FEMA APIs were down (not needed - we have local data)
- File naming convention differences in script vs actual files

### **üí∞ QCT/DDA ANALYSIS**
- **36/38 sites eligible** for 130% basis boost (94.7%)
- **2 sites not eligible**: Orange County & Henderson County (non-metro areas)
- **TOWER correction**: Fixed 4 numeric county codes for proper analysis

### **üîß ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING ISSUE**
**Problem Identified**: TCEQ LPST database missing coordinate columns
- **29,646 environmental records** available but no lat/lng for proximity analysis
- **4,555 Harris County records** but cannot perform distance calculations
- **Recommendation**: Phase I ESA for all sites or obtain geocoded environmental database
