- 4% LIHTC (Low-Income Housing Tax Credit) deals with bonds (PAB - Private Activity Bonds)
- 9% LIHTC projects

## Geographic Focus Areas Analyzed

### 1. Houston, Texas Metro Area
**Five sites analyzed with significant challenges identified:**

#### Site 1: 6053 Bellfort Ave, Houston, TX 77033
- **Critical Issue:** Entire site in 100-year floodplain
- **PMA Population:** 99,377
- **Competition:** 
  - Landing on Orem: 369 units under construction (all 60% AMI, including 51 4BRs)
  - Andover Village: 120 units under construction (30/50/60% mix, 48 at 60% AMI)
- **Capture Rate Strategy:** 15% cap rate election may be needed; could exclude census tract with Landing on Orem to keep under 10%

#### Site 2: N Lake Houston Pkwy, Houston, TX 77044
- **Flood Risk:** 500-year flood plain
- **PMA Population:** 103,795
- **Competition:** EMLI at Mesa Gardens - 300 total units (15 at 30%, 285 at 60%, 1-3BR) under construction

#### Site 3: Aldine Westfield Rd, Houston, TX 77093
- **Flood Risk:** Mixed 100/500-year floodplain
- **PMA Population:** 89,588
- **Competition:** NHH Berry - 180 units under construction (½ at 50%, ½ at 60%)

#### Site 4: North Beltway 8, East of T.C. Jester, Houston, TX 77038
- **Critical Issues:** 
  - 100-year floodplain and floodway on site
  - **Multiple gas pipelines running east/west at south end of site**
- **PMA Population:** 89,377
- **Competition:** 
  - Houston at Ella: 146 units under construction (income average with market rate)
  - Summit at Renaissance Park: 325 units (submitted first unit status report showing all vacant)
  - Park at Kirkstall and Torrey Chase: Both stabilized (outside PMA)

#### Site 5: 22940 Imperial Valley Dr, Houston, TX 77073
- **PMA Population:** 88,288
- **Competition:**
  - Saddle Creek Village: 2023 9% award (only unstable family HTC project in PMA)
  - **Enclave at Louetta:** 358 units awarded 4% HTC in May 2025 (all at 60% AMI) - just north of PMA boundary, needs to be addressed

### 2. San Antonio Area

#### Richland Hills Site
- Analysis provided using 15% capture rate maximum (allowed for general population 4% HTC in MSAs with population over 1M)
- Details provided in separate analysis (referenced Tyler and Kerrville confirmations)

#### Gus McCrae & 1604 Site
- **Recommendation:** ADVISE AGAINST due to relatively remote location
- **Historical Context:** Previously did study for Reserve at Lone Oak during shale oil boom period
- Analysis suggests market conditions have changed significantly

### 3. Other Texas Markets

#### Tyler, TX
- **PMA Population:** 97,724
- Market analysis provided with demand/capture rate calculations

#### Kerrville, TX
- **Unit Mix Strategy:** 1/2/3BR all at 60% AMI assumption
- **Flexibility Note:** Kirt indicated ability to adjust household distribution if more 3BR units needed

## Key Market Study Methodologies

### Capture Rate Analysis
- **Standard Threshold:** Under 10% capture rate preferred
- **4% LIHTC Exception:** 15% capture rate maximum allowed for general population in MSAs over 1M population
- **Strategic Adjustments:** Can modify PMA boundaries to exclude problematic census tracts when necessary

### Site Due Diligence Factors
1. **Flood Risk Assessment** (major concern in Houston)
2. **Pipeline Infrastructure** (oil and gas pipelines via TX DOT layer)
3. **Competition Mapping** (existing, under construction, and pipeline projects)
4. **Income Targeting Analysis** (30%, 50%, 60% AMI mixes)
5. **Unit Type Distribution** (1BR, 2BR, 3BR, 4BR demand analysis)

### Competitive Project Tracking
- **Unstable Projects:** Under construction or recently awarded
- **Stabilized Projects:** Fully leased and operational
- **Pipeline Projects:** Awarded but not yet started
- **Unit Status Reporting:** Tracking lease-up performance

## Development Strategy Insights

### Minimum Viable Project Size
- **4% Bond Deals:** Typically require 250+ units minimum
- **Financial Threshold:** "Numbers typically don't pencil out for smaller deals"
- **Target Density:** Actively seeking sites supporting 200+ units initially, with preference for 250+ unit potential

### Unit Mix Optimization
- **Standard Assumption:** 1/2/3BR mix at 60% AMI
- **4BR Considerations:** Included in demand analysis where market supports
- **Flexibility:** Household distribution can be adjusted based on specific market needs

## Risk Factors Identified

### Houston-Specific Challenges
1. **Widespread flood plain issues** across multiple sites
2. **Gas pipeline infrastructure** creating development constraints  
3. **Heavy competition** from multiple large projects in construction phase
4. **Recent awards** creating oversupply concerns (e.g., Enclave at Louetta)

### General Market Risks
1. **Remote locations** reducing market viability
2. **Capture rate challenges** from competitive oversupply
3. **Changing economic conditions** (referenced oil boom cycle changes)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Houston Portfolio Review:** Serious reconsideration needed due to flood/pipeline issues
2. **San Antonio Focus:** Richland Hills appears more viable than Gus McCrae site
3. **Market Diversification:** Tyler and Kerrville showing better fundamentals

### Due Diligence Requirements
1. **Environmental Assessment:** Flood certification for all Houston sites
2. **Infrastructure Review:** Pipeline impact studies for affected sites
3. **Market Study Updates:** Competition pipeline monitoring
4. **Financial Modeling:** 250+ unit scenarios for viability
