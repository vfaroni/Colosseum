**Required Analysis**:
1. **Market Study Compliance**: 250+ unit minimum, 17-18 units/acre density verification
2. **Environmental Screening**: TCEQ database integration for Phase I ESA requirements  
3. **Competition Analysis**: Existing LIHTC developments within market areas
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Local zoning, permitting, infrastructure assessments
5. **Financial Feasibility**: Construction costs, AMI rents, investor returns

### üìä EXPECTED DELIVERABLES

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### üîß ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK BUILT
**Location**: `/Colosseum/modules/data_intelligence/TDHCA_RAG/`

**Key Scripts:**
- `final_4dataset_analyzer.py`: Complete 4-dataset analysis engine
- `batch_complete_375.py`: Reliable batch processor with checkpointing
- `alternative_zip_lookup.py`: Working Nominatim ZIP code service

**Data Sources Integrated:**
- HUD QCT database (2 Excel tabs, 85,390 tracts nationwide)
- HUD Metro DDA database (22,192 ZIP areas nationwide)  
- HUD Non-Metro DDA counties (105 counties nationwide, 68 in Texas)
- Census geocoding API (tract identification)
- Nominatim geocoding API (ZIP code identification)

### üìã QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOLS
- **98.4% successful analysis rate** (369/375 sites)
- **Cross-validation against known QCT/DDA areas** (Dallas, Houston, Austin verified)
- **Rate limiting compliance** (Census 1.1s, Nominatim 1.2s per request)
- **Checkpoint system** prevents data loss during long analyses
- **Error handling** for API failures and timeout management

## LESSONS LEARNED

### ‚úÖ WHAT WORKED WELL
1. **Multi-agent coordination**: STRIKE LEADER, WINGMAN, TOWER roles clearly defined
2. **User domain expertise**: Critical for identifying data source issues
3. **Iterative problem solving**: Fixed multiple technical barriers systematically
4. **Backup data sources**: Nominatim resolved Census API ZIP failures
5. **Batch processing with checkpoints**: Guaranteed completion despite long runtime

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCOVERIES
1. **Initial 50/375 low results were justified concern**: System was broken
2. **DDA analysis completely failed initially**: Zero DDAs found due to ZIP lookup failure
3. **Non-Metro DDA database 90% incomplete**: Missing 63 of 68 Texas counties
4. **Boundary-spanning analysis needed**: Single GPS points miss partial coverage opportunities
5. **API reliability issues**: Government APIs require robust error handling

### üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE
1. **Implement parcel boundary analysis**: Identify partial QCT/DDA coverage for larger sites
2. **Add alternative geocoding services**: Reduce dependency on single API sources
3. **Create automated data validation**: Cross-check results against known good areas
4. **Develop real-time monitoring**: Track API performance and switch services as needed
5. **Build comprehensive testing framework**: Validate against multiple metro areas
