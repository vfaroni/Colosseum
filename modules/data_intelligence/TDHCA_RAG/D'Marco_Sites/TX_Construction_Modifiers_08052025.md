## üìä Regional Construction Cost Multipliers
*Base = 1.00 (Rural Texas Baseline)*

### Major Metropolitan Areas

| Region | Construction Multiplier | Per Unit Cost* | Variance | Key Factors |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Dallas Metro** | 1.18x | ~$220,000 | +18% | Highest cost region - skilled labor shortage, competitive market |
| **Austin Metro** | 1.14x | ~$212,000 | +14% | High growth market with strict environmental regulations |
| **Houston Metro** | 1.12x | ~$208,000 | +12% | Major metro with high labor costs, hurricane/flood requirements |
| **San Antonio Metro** | 1.06x | ~$197,000 | +6% | Moderate costs with military/government influence |

**Counties Included:**
- **Dallas Metro**: Dallas, Tarrant, Collin, Denton, Rockwall
- **Austin Metro**: Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell
- **Houston Metro**: Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery, Brazoria, Galveston
- **San Antonio Metro**: Bexar, Guadalupe, Comal, Wilson

### Rural & Secondary Markets

| Region | Construction Multiplier | Per Unit Cost* | Variance | Key Factors |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **West Texas** | 0.98x | ~$182,000 | -2% | Oil/gas economy with material transportation challenges |
| **South Texas** | 0.95x | ~$177,000 | -5% | Moderate costs with border economy influence |
| **East Texas Rural** | 0.92x | ~$171,000 | -8% | Lower labor costs offset by material transportation |
| **Rural Baseline** | 1.00x | $186,000 | 0% | Rural Texas baseline for cost comparisons |

**Counties Included:**
- **West Texas**: Midland, Ector, Lubbock, Amarillo
- **South Texas**: Cameron, Hidalgo, Webb, Starr
- **East Texas Rural**: Henderson, Orange, Jefferson, Hardin, Tyler

*Based on 60-unit LIHTC project baseline

## üåä Flood Zone Insurance Requirements & Costs

### Annual Insurance Premiums Per Unit

| Flood Zone | Annual Premium | Operating Cost Impact | Description |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Zone X** | $0 | 1.00x | No flood insurance required - minimal risk zone |
| **Zone AE** | $1,200 | 1.03x | 1% annual chance flood - insurance required |
| **Zone A** | $1,400 | 1.04x | 1% annual chance flood - no base flood elevation |
| **Zone VE** | $2,500 | 1.08x | Coastal high hazard - very expensive insurance |
| **Zone AO** | $800 | 1.02x | Sheet flow flooding - moderate insurance cost |
| **Not Mapped** | $0 | 1.00x | Outside mapped flood hazard areas |

### Impact on Development
- Properties in AE/A zones require flood insurance per lender requirements
- VE zones (coastal) can add $150,000+ annually to operating costs (60-unit project)
- Insurance costs must be factored into DCR calculations for underwriting

## üèóÔ∏è Base Construction Cost Components
*Per Unit Estimates for 60-Unit LIHTC Project*

| Cost Category | Base Amount | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Hard Costs** | $135,000 | Structure, sitework, utilities, construction |
| **Soft Costs** | $25,000 | Architecture, engineering, permits, legal |
| **Developer Fee** | $18,000 | Developer fee and overhead (typically 10-15% of TDC) |
| **Contingency** | $8,000 | Construction contingency (5-10% of hard costs) |
| **Total Base Cost** | **$186,000** | Total development cost baseline per unit |

## üìà Additional Market Factors

### Skilled Labor Shortage Multipliers
- **Dallas**: 1.08x (highest shortage)
- **Austin**: 1.06x (tech sector competition)
- **Houston**: 1.05x (energy sector competition)
- **San Antonio**: 1.02x (moderate shortage)
- **Rural Areas**: 0.98x (available labor)

### Material Supply Chain Premiums
- **Hurricane Risk Premium**: 1.03x (Gulf Coast areas)
- **Transportation Premium**: 1.02x (rural areas >100 miles from distribution)
- **Urban Delivery Premium**: 1.01x (major metros - traffic/logistics)

## üí∞ Cost Impact Examples
*Based on 60-Unit LIHTC Development*

### Scenario Comparison

| Location | Per Unit Cost | Total Project Cost | Variance from Rural |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Dallas Metro (High Cost)** | $220,000 | $13,200,000 | +$2,040,000 |
| **Houston Metro (Flood Zone AE)** | $214,000 | $12,840,000 | +$1,680,000 |
| **San Antonio Metro** | $197,000 | $11,820,000 | +$660,000 |
| **Rural Texas Baseline** | $186,000 | $11,160,000 | Baseline |
| **East Texas Rural (Low Cost)** | $171,000 | $10,260,000 | -$900,000 |

### Key Insights
- Dallas-to-Rural cost difference: **$2.94M per 60-unit project**
- Flood insurance (Zone AE) adds: **$72,000 annually** (60 units)
- Rural developments can save: **15-20% on total development costs**

## üéØ Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Portfolio Optimization
- Concentrate rural/lower-cost sites for maximum capital efficiency
- Target East Texas and South Texas for highest ROI potential
- Balance portfolio with strategic metro sites for market presence

### 2. Metropolitan Market Strategy
- Ensure adequate 9% credit allocation for high-cost Dallas/Austin markets
- Consider 4% bond deals in Houston/San Antonio with moderate costs
- Factor in 10-20% cost premium for major metro developments

### 3. Flood Risk Mitigation
- Prioritize Zone X properties to eliminate insurance requirements
- Factor $1,200-2,500/unit annual insurance into pro forma for flood zones
- Consider elevation/mitigation strategies for high-value flood zone sites

### 4. Competitive Application Advantages
- Use precise regional cost data for more accurate LIHTC applications
- Demonstrate cost efficiency in rural markets for scoring advantages
- Highlight flood mitigation strategies in coastal/flood-prone areas

### 5. Development Timing
- Monitor labor market conditions - costs trending up 3-5% annually in metros
- Lock in construction contracts early in hot markets (Dallas/Austin)
- Consider phased development in rural areas to manage resources
