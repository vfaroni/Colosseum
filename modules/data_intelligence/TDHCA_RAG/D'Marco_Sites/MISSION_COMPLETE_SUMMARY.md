- **East Texas Rural**: -8.8% construction cost savings (lowest)
- **Rural Baseline**: Baseline comparison point

**Business Impact**: 
- üìà $32,760 cost difference per 60-unit project between regions
- üéØ Strategic site selection guidance for cost optimization
- üí∞ Accurate pro forma development for LIHTC applications

### **üåä Flood Zone Insurance Costs - INTEGRATED ‚úÖ**
**Insurance Cost Framework**:
- **Zone X**: $0/unit annually (no insurance required)
- **Zone AE**: $1,200/unit annually (1% annual chance flood)
- **Zone A**: $1,400/unit annually (no base flood elevation)
- **Zone VE**: $2,500/unit annually (coastal high hazard)

**Coverage Achievement**: 100% flood zone determination (38/38 sites)

### **üè´ School Amenities Analysis - OPERATIONAL ‚úÖ**
**Database Integration**: 9,307 active Texas schools with coordinates  
**Scoring System**: 75-point LIHTC amenity scoring framework  
**Results**:
- üìö 24/38 sites rated "EXCELLENT" for school access
- üéØ 30/38 sites have complete school level access (K-12)
- üìä Average amenity score: 53.7/75 points
