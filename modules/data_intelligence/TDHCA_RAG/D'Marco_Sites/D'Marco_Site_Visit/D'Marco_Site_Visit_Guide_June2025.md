## Development Process & Architecture Decisions

### Phase 1: Static Guide Creation
**File:** `DMarco_Site_Visit_Guide_June2025.md`

**Approach:** Traditional markdown document with:
- Site-specific underwriting questions
- LIHTC regulatory framework (4% vs 9% considerations)
- Market positioning analysis
- Comprehensive due diligence checklist

**Inspiration Sources:**
- CLAUDE.md Texas LIHTC Production System documentation
- TDHCA competition rules (One Mile/Two Mile fatal flaws)
- Regional cost multipliers and economic viability frameworks
- Institutional underwriting best practices

**Content Structure:**
- Executive summary with site overview
- Individual site analysis sections
- LIHTC-specific regulatory considerations
- Field validation checklists

### Phase 2: Data Integration Enhancement
**Challenge:** Static documents lack real-time market intelligence

**Solution:** Embed live data from existing production systems:
- TDHCA Project Database (3,189 projects with coordinates)
- Census ACS API for poverty rates
- External mapping and demographic services

**Technical Architecture:**
```python
# Core data sources
tdhca_file = "TX_TDHCA_Project_List_05252025.xlsx"
census_api_key = "06ece0121263282cd9ffd753215b007b8f9a3dfc"
base_path = "/Users/williamrice/HERR Dropbox/.../Data Sets"

# Processing pipeline
1. Load TDHCA competition database
2. Geocode site coordinates
3. Analyze competition within 1-mile and 2-mile radius
4. Fetch Census tract poverty data via FCC + ACS APIs
5. Generate HTML with embedded data
```

### Phase 3: Interactive Features (JavaScript Navigation)
**File:** `create_enhanced_site_visit_guide.py`

**Approach:** JavaScript-powered navigation with:
- Site selector dropdown
- Toggle competition display
- Interactive maps integration

**Issues Encountered:**
- JavaScript dependencies created offline reliability concerns
- Complex navigation didn't suit field use requirements
- Mobile performance issues with large data sets

**Decision:** Abandon JavaScript approach for embedded HTML

### Phase 4: Embedded HTML Solution
**File:** `create_final_embedded_guide.py`

**Breakthrough:** Direct data embedding in HTML content
- No JavaScript dependencies
- Works offline once loaded
- All data visible immediately
- Mobile-optimized responsive design

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
def create_html_with_embedded_data(md_content, sites_data):
    # Convert markdown to HTML
    # Inject live competition data directly into content
    # Add external links for Census and mapping
    # Apply professional styling with high contrast
```

### Phase 5: Data Accuracy & User Experience Fixes
**File:** `create_fixed_embedded_guide.py` (Final Production Version)

**Issues Identified & Resolved:**

#### Data Extraction Problems
- **Problem:** TDHCA data showing "Address Unknown, City Unknown"
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect column name mapping
- **Solution:** Discovered trailing space in "Project Address " column
- **Fix:** Updated data extraction to use correct column names

#### Styling & Contrast Issues
- **Problem:** Purple background with white text had poor readability
- **Solution:** Redesigned with light backgrounds and dark text
- **Implementation:** Professional color scheme with clear visual hierarchy

#### Coordinate Accuracy Problems
- **Problem:** Apple Maps links 23+ miles off target
- **Root Cause:** Addresses for undeveloped land may not exist yet
- **Solution:** 
  - Removed Apple Maps integration
  - Used city/area approximations for coordinates
  - Provided Google Maps backup with address search

#### External Link Failures
- **Problem:** Census links directed to general US data instead of tract-specific
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect URL structure for Census.gov API
- **Solution:** Fixed URL format: `data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1701?g=1400000US{tract}`
- **Enhancement:** Added Census Reporter alternative links

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Sources Integration

#### TDHCA Competition Analysis
```python
# Competition detection logic
for project in self.tdhca_data.iterrows():
    distance_miles = geodesic(site_coords, project_coords).miles
    
    if distance_miles <= 1.0 and years_ago <= 3:
        risk_level = 'HIGH RISK - One Mile Rule'
        is_fatal_9pct = True
    elif distance_miles <= 2.0 and years_ago <= 1:
        risk_level = 'MEDIUM RISK - Two Mile Rule'
```

#### Census Poverty Data Integration
```python
# Two-step process for tract-level poverty data
1. FCC API: Get census tract from coordinates
2. Census ACS API: Get poverty data for specific tract

fcc_url = f"https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/area"
census_url = f"https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5"
census_params = {
    'get': 'B17001_002E,B17001_001E,NAME',
    'for': f'tract:{tract_code}',
    'in': f'state:{state_fips} county:{county_fips}',
    'key': self.census_api_key
}
```

#### External Links Generation
```python
def generate_census_links(poverty_data, site):
    # Direct poverty data table
    census_poverty_url = f"https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1701?g=1400000US{tract_number}"
    
    # Census Reporter profile
    census_reporter_url = f"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US{tract_number}/"

def generate_map_links(site):
    # Google Maps with coordinates
    google_coords_url = f"https://www.google.com/maps?q={lat},{lng}&z=17"
    
    # Address search backup
    google_search_url = f"https://www.google.com/maps/search/{address}"
    
    # Street View integration
    streetview_url = f"https://www.google.com/maps/@{lat},{lng},3a,75y,0h,90t/..."
```

### HTML Structure & Styling

#### Responsive Design Implementation
```css
.site-section {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e2e8f0 0%, #cbd5e0 100%);
    color: #1a202c;
    padding: 30px;
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .site-header { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
    .data-summary { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }
}
```

#### Data Visualization
- **Competition Summary:** Grid layout with statistical cards
- **Risk Assessment:** Color-coded badges (green/orange/red)
- **Project Details:** Structured grid with clear data hierarchy
- **External Links:** Touch-friendly buttons with icons

---

## Key Discoveries & Lessons Learned

### Data Quality Issues

#### TDHCA Database Column Names
**Discovery:** Excel columns have trailing spaces that break standard name matching
- `'Project Address '` (note trailing space)
- `'Project City'` 
- `'Project County'`

**Impact:** Initial data extraction returned "Unknown" for all project details
**Solution:** Account for trailing spaces in column name mapping

#### Coordinate Accuracy for Development Land
**Discovery:** Site addresses may not exist yet (vacant land for development)
**Impact:** Geocoding services return no results or inaccurate coordinates
**Solution:** Use city/area approximations with coordinate verification utilities

#### Census API URL Structure
**Discovery:** Census.gov changed URL structure for direct table access
**Old Format:** `data.census.gov/table?g=1400000US{tract}&tid=ACSST5Y2022.S1701`
**Working Format:** `data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1701?g=1400000US{tract}`

### Mobile Optimization Requirements

#### Field Use Considerations
- **Offline Capability:** Essential once loaded for areas with poor cell service
- **Touch Interface:** Minimum 44px touch targets for links and buttons
- **High Contrast:** Critical for outdoor use in bright sunlight
- **Single-Hand Operation:** Navigation must work with thumb-only operation

#### Performance Optimization
- **Embedded Data:** Eliminate external API calls during field use
- **Image Optimization:** Minimize graphics, use CSS styling instead
- **Font Selection:** System fonts for fast loading and legibility

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### LIHTC Analysis Framework Compatibility
**Success:** Site visit guide uses same data sources as production analysis systems
- TDHCA Project Database consistency
- Census API key and methodology alignment
- Coordinate system standardization (WGS84)

**Benefit:** Field validation can be directly compared to desk analysis results

#### Export and Distribution
**Format:** Self-contained HTML files for:
- Email distribution to field teams
- Offline storage on mobile devices
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, desktop)
