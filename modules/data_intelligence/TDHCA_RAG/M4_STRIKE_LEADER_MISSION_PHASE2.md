# STRIKE LEADER MISSION: PHASE 2 TDHCA RULES ANALYSIS
## FOR: M4 BEAST AGENT

**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**From**: Strike Leader  
**To**: M4 Beast Agent  
**Mission Type**: Phase 2 Analysis - 155 Qualified Sites  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: READY FOR M4 EXECUTION  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase 1 QCT/DDA screening COMPLETE with 155 basis boost eligible sites identified from original 375.

## CRITICAL: FEMA FLOOD DATA COVERAGE CLARIFICATION

### üéØ M4 BEAST - TWO DIFFERENT COVERAGE METRICS:

**LOCAL FEMA MAPS**: 78.1% coverage (what M4 is referencing)
- Location: `/Data_Sets/environmental/FEMA_Flood_Maps/TX/`
- Coverage: Limited Texas counties with geometric flood zone data
- Status: Incomplete statewide coverage

**THIS PROJECT COVERAGE**: 92.3% (143/155 sites) - ACHIEVED!
- **DATA SOURCE**: Existing CoStar flood data in MASTER Excel file  
- **METHODOLOGY**: Used pre-existing FEMA flood zone classifications from CoStar export  
- **ADVANTAGE**: No need to use incomplete local FEMA maps or API calls

### Where THIS Project Data Comes From:
```
MASTER FILE: /D'Marco_Sites/Analysis_Results/MASTER_155_BoostEligible_Sites_20250731_223500.xlsx
COLUMNS USED:
- Column 46: "Flood Risk" (Yes/No) - 155/155 sites (100% coverage)
- Column 47: "Flood Zone" (FEMA zones) - 143/155 sites (92.3% coverage)
```

### Flood Zone Distribution (143 sites with data):
- **B and X**: 103 sites (LOW_RISK)
- **AE**: 29 sites (HIGH_RISK - eliminate)  
- **A**: 8 sites (HIGH_RISK - eliminate)
- **C and X**: 2 sites (LOW_RISK)
- **AH**: 1 site (HIGH_RISK - eliminate)

### Results Achieved:
- **38 sites flagged for elimination** (HIGH_RISK flood zones)
- **117 sites remain viable** after flood screening
- **Elimination rate**: 24.5%
- **Success rate**: 75.5% sites viable

### Files Generated:
- **Excel**: `Phase2_Flood_Screened_Sites_20250731_232355.xlsx`
- **JSON Summary**: `Phase2_Flood_Screening_Summary_20250731_232355.json`
- **Key Sheet**: "Viable_Sites_After_Flood" (117 sites for next phase)

**Input**: 117 flood-viable sites  
**Objective**: Eliminate sites >3 miles from major highways  
**Status**: Script created, needs execution (timed out due to geometric calculations)

## M4 BEAST MISSION ASSIGNMENTS

### PRIORITY 1: Complete Highway Access Screening
**Objective**: Identify and eliminate sites isolated from major roads  
**Input**: 117 flood-viable sites from flood screening results  
**Script**: `phase2_highway_access_screener.py`  
**Expected Output**: ~80-90 sites with good highway access

**Highway Datasets Available**:
```
/Data_Sets/texas/TxDOT_Roadways/
- texas_interstate_highways.gpkg
