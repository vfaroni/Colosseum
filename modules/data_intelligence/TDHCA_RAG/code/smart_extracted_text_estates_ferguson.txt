Supportive Housing SRO Development or Supportive Housing Development where all Units are Efficiency UnitsThe Development Site is located within the attendance zone of an elementary school, a middle school or a high school that 
has a TEA Accountability Rating of "Not Rated: Senate Bill 1365" for 2022. In districts with district-wide enrollment or choice 
districts an Applicant shall use the rating of the closest elementary, middle and high school, respectively, which may 
possibly be attended by the tenants in determining whether or not disclosure is required. Schools with an application process for admittance, limited enrollment or other requirements that may prevent a child from attending will not be 
considered as the closest school or the school which attendance zone contains the site. School ratings will be determined 
by the school number, so that in the case where a new school is formed or named or consolidated with another school but 
is considered to have the same number that rating will be used. A school that has never been rated by the Texas Education Agency will use the district rating. If a school is configured to serve grades that do not align with the Texas Education 
Agency's conventions for defining elementary schools (typically grades K-5 or K-6), middle schools (typically grades 6-8 or 7-8) and high schools (typically grades 9-12), the school will be considered to have the lower of the ratings of the schools that would be combined to meet those conventions. In determining the ratings for all three levels of schools, ratings for all 
grades K-12 must be included, meaning that two or more schools' ratings may be combined. Sixth grade centers will be 
considered as part of the middle school rating. Evidence of mitigation for each of the schools in the attendance zone that 
has a TEA Accountability Rating of "Not Rated: Senate Bill 1365" for 2022 must meet the two criteria below.  By checking these boxes on the Development Owner Certification, the applicant agrees to provide the after-school learning center, 
which will be a requirement of the LURA.
--Documentation from a person authorized to speak on behalf of the school district with oversight of the school in question 
that indicates the specific plans in place and current progress towards meeting the goals and performance objectives 
identified in the Campus Improvement Plan and in restoring the school(s) to an acceptable rating status.  Documentation 
should meet the requirements of 10 TAC § 11.101(a)(3)(D)(iii)(I). 
--The Applicant has committed that it will operate an after school learning center that offers at a minimum 15 hours of weekly, organized, on-site educational services provided to elementary, middle and high school children that meets the 
requirement of 10 TAC §11.101(a)(3)(D)(iii)(II). 
The Application meets the following exception(s).

Hello Michael, 
We are the development group working on the senior living community, Estates at Ferguson, located at 9220 Ferguson 
Road. Because we are using housing tax credits in the ﬁnancing structure for this development we are required to 
provide the city with a hold harmless le Ʃer. Basically, this le Ʃer states that if the zoning is not approved, the applicant 
will not seek any type of legal ac Ɵon. When you have a chance, could you please send me an email con ﬁrming receipt? 
Thank you,

Hello Michael, 
We are the development group working on the senior living community, Estates at Ferguson, located at 9220 Ferguson 
Road. Because we are using housing tax credits in the ﬁnancing structure for this development we are required to 
provide the city with a hold harmless le Ʃer. Basically, this le Ʃer states that if the zoning is not approved, the applicant 
will not seek any type of legal ac Ɵon. When you have a chance, could you please send me an email con ﬁrming receipt? 
Thank you,

Dear Bob, Adrian, and Chris : 
 
The following quotation is indicative of Bank OZK ’s (Bank OZK  is also referred to as “ the Bank ”) 
initial interest in potentially making a loan to Borrower to acquire  the Land and develop the 
Property. Please note that this letter is not a commitment to lend. Instead, this letter is an  
expression of initial interest containing a very brief outline of potential lending terms.  
 
Borrower:  A to-be-determined  entity (“ Borrower ”), which is controlled by 
Generation Housing Partners , LLC  & Hill Tide Development , 
LLC  (“Sponsor ”) or a related or affiliated entity. Sponsor is a 
signatory to this Term Sheet and liable for all binding terms and 
conditions hereunder. In any event, the borrowing entity must be 
acceptable to Bank.  
 
Closing Date (est):  December  1, 2023  
 
Loan Amount:  The Loan Amount shall be limited to the lesser of (i) $25,000,000 , 
(ii) 75.0% of the sum of the  (a) cost to acquire the Land/  Existing 
Property , (b) cost to construct the  improvements / substantially 
rehabilitate the existing improvements, (c) amount needed to fund 
closing costs and related expenses (a , b, and c are hereinafter 
collectively  referred to as “ Project  Costs ”), or (iii) 75.0% of the 
appraised value of the Prope rty “as-stabilized”  plus the value of 
the low income housing tax credits (“LIHTC’s”).

Page 2 of 9 
 
 
 LIHTC Equity :  It is expected that the Borrower will secure equity  (“LIHTC 
Equity ”) equal to approximately  $16,082,751 . Funding schedule 
for LIHTC equity must be approved by Bank prior to closing.  The 
terms and conditions of the operating or partnership agreement 
must be acceptable to the Bank , including the equity pay -in 
schedule.  
 
Developer Fee:  The Borrower shall be permitted to defer and contribute all or a 
portion of the Developer Fee (“ Deferred Developer Fee ”), 
subject to Bank approval.  Any Developer Fee to be paid prior to 
Loan maturity or payment will be according to a schedule agreed 
upon by the Bank, the syndicator providing the LIHTC Equity,

entities or persons contained in the budget other than those 
specifically detailed or discussed herein. Sponsor further 
acknowledges that any such undisclosed fees or payments will 
be removed from the final budget prior to closing in

CME One Month Term SOFR (“ Term SOFR ”) plus 290 basis

equal to 4.55%.   At Loan closing, the Loan documents will set a 
minimum all -in, per annum interest rate equal to the Spread plus 
the SOFR Floor (the “ Minimum Interest Rate ”). Currently, 
Term SOFR is trading at approximately 5.09%, thus the current 
indicative rate would be  7.99%. Currently, the Minimum Interest 
Rate would be 7.45%.  
 
Term:  The initial Term of  the Loan  shall be for thirty -six (36) months.  
 
Interest Reserve:  The Bank will size the Interest Reserve based on the projected

released at or near substantial completion of the Development.

stimated RJAHI  Fund Total Capital:  $16,082,750. 
Note that actual contributions are based on actual credits delivered.  If actual 
RJAHI  Fund Total Credits are l ess than the estimated amoun t, RJAHI  Fund Total 
Capital will be reduced by the sho rtfall times the C redit Price.  If actual RJAHI  
Fund Total Credits are greater than the estimated amount (“Excess Credits”), 
then the RJAHI  Fund Total Capital will be increas ed by an amount equal to the  
Excess Credits times the Credit Price, but RJAHI  Fund Total Capital sha ll not 
exceed 105% of the Estimated RJAHI  Fund Total Capital except as provided 
below.  The RJAHI  Fund will specify the terms, if any, under which it will 
contribute capital in respect  of any Excess Credits attributable to an additional 
reservation of Credits, and/or those that would otherwise cause capital 
contributions to exceed 105% of the Estimated Total Capital.  If those terms provide for a credit price  less than the Credit Price,  the Gen eral Partners can 
accept or reject those terms.  Any Excess Cred its for which the RJAHI  Fund is 
unwilling to contribute capital or that the General Partners are unwilling to 
allocate to RJAHI  on the terms specified by th e RJAHI  Fund shall be alloca ted to 
the General Partners.

“Stabilized Operations ” means the date upon which all of the following 
events have occurred:  (i)  final completion of the Project and f inal closing of all 
permanent financing, and (ii)  Rent must be not less than $ 179,245 in each month 
of Stabilized Operatio n based on rental rates that, assuming one hundred percent 
(100%) occupancy, would achieve a monthly rental income of $192,737, and (iii ) 
for e ach of three (3) consecutive months (the last of which must end after or 
concur rently with Final Closing), the lesser of:  (a) actual Net Operating Income, 
or (b) Net Operating Income determined as if “Rent” equal ed 93% of the rent that 
would be due and payable if the Project attained 100% occupancy based on rental 
rates then being c harged for the Project (each as ap proved by RJAHI) is at least 
equal to 115 % of the Partnership’s Must -pay Debt Service. Achievement o f 
Stabilized Operations shall be sub ject to  the r eview and approval of RJAHI .

the RJAHI  Fund shall be adjusted if and to the extent that t he RJAHI  Fund is 
admitted after Credits have begun to run.  
 
In the event that the actual C redits with respec t to the first C redit Year or 
second Credit Year  are more than the Credits projected for such years, then the 
capita l contribution of the RJAHI  Fund to the Par tnership shall be increased by 
an amount (the “Upward Timing Adjustment ”) equal  to 50% of such excess; 
provided, that any such increase is subject to the overall limitation that RJAHI  
Fund Total Capital cannot exc eed 105% of est imated RJAHI  Total Capital 
without RJAHI  Fund consent.  The Upward Timing Adjustment shall be made 
and appl ied to increase the Stabilization Capital Contribution.  It is understood 
and agreed that the Upward Timing Adjustment is intended to address any acceleratio n in the de livery of  the first or second  year of the Credit Period from 
the projected Credit amount s during such year where the total  projected Credits 
for the entire Credit Period is not affected and that the Upward Timing Adjustment may be decreased if the RJAHI  Fund determ ines in the exercise of its 
sole and absolute discretion that a smaller Upward Ti ming Adjustment must be 
paid in order to maintain the expected return on investment of its investors.

Any excess costs will not be considered loans or capital contri butions.  
However, the General Partners will also advance funds as n eeded during 
construction if  proceeds of financing and/or capital contributions are not 
yet available to pay such costs.  Such advances will be repaid, without 
interest, once such sources of funds become available.  
 The General Partners will also guarantee that the permanent financing  
will close and that the debt service on the permanent fina ncing will not 
exceed an amount that would allow the Partnership to achieve Stabilized Operations wi thin a reasonable time.  Any reduction in principal amount

right to require the Gen eral Partners to repurchase the RJAHI  Fund's 
interest for a price that returns 110% of i ts investment to date plus 
interest and any tax liability attributable to such payment.  Examples of  
such events include failure to complete construction, achieve break even 
operations or achieve S tabilized Operations by agreed -upon dates, failure

Fund for the shortfall on  a dollar for dollar basis.  If it is determined that 
the shortfall in Credits will apply to future years as well, General Partners will r efund an amount equal to the present value of those future 
credits.  If the RJAHI  Fund is subjec t to recapture (includ ing 
disallowance of credits) of previously claimed credits, the General 
Partners shall reimburse the RJAHI  Fund for its recapture amount.  To 
the extent that payments in respect of the Tax Credit Guaranty a re 
taxable, the payments sha ll be grossed -up to re imburse the RJAHI  Fund 
for the tax lia bility.  
 
 This guaranty shall apply to a period that ends at the end of the LIHTC 
compliance period.  
 
The General Partners will not be obligated if the reduction in the  amount 
of Credits or recapt ure is a result of a c hange in the tax law or the 
dispositio n by the RJAHI  Fund of its interest.

events have occurred:  (i)  final completion of the Project and f inal closing of all 
permanent financing, and (ii)  Rent must be not less than $ 179,245 in each month

(100%) occupancy, would achieve a monthly rental income of $192,737, and (iii ) 
for e ach of three (3) consecutive months (the last of which must end after or 
concur rently with Final Closing), the lesser of:  (a) actual Net Operating Income, 
or (b) Net Operating Income determined as if “Rent” equal ed 93% of the rent that 
would be due and payable if the Project attained 100% occupancy based on rental 
rates then being c harged for the Project (each as ap proved by RJAHI) is at least 
equal to 115 % of the Partnership’s Must -pay Debt Service. Achievement o f 
Stabilized Operations shall be sub ject to  the r eview and approval of RJAHI .

capita l contribution of the RJAHI  Fund to the Par tnership shall be increased by 
an amount (the “Upward Timing Adjustment ”) equal  to 50% of such excess;

Fund Total Capital cannot exc eed 105% of est imated RJAHI  Total Capital 
without RJAHI  Fund consent.  The Upward Timing Adjustment shall be made 
and appl ied to increase the Stabilization Capital Contribution.  It is understood 
and agreed that the Upward Timing Adjustment is intended to address any acceleratio n in the de livery of  the first or second  year of the Credit Period from 
the projected Credit amount s during such year where the total  projected Credits 
for the entire Credit Period is not affected and that the Upward Timing Adjustment may be decreased if the RJAHI  Fund determ ines in the exercise of its 
sole and absolute discretion that a smaller Upward Ti ming Adjustment must be 
paid in order to maintain the expected return on investment of its investors.

such events include failure to complete construction, achieve break even 
operations or achieve S tabilized Operations by agreed -upon dates, failure

In your letter dated February 5, 2013, you requested classification as a public charity 
described in section 509(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
In our letter dated December 1985, we determined that you were exempt under section 
501 (c)(3) of the Code. We further determined that you weren't a private foundation and 
you were classified as a public charity described in section 509(a)(3) of the Code. 
Based on the information you provided, we determined you meet the requirements for 
classification as a public charity described in section 509(a)(2) of the Code. 
Accordingly, we have updated your public charity status in our records as you requested. 
Since your exempt status wasn't under consideration, you continue to be classified as an 
organization exempt from federal income tax under section 501 (c)(3) of the Code. 
Grantors and contributors may generally rely on this determination of your foundation 
status unless the Internal Revenue Service publishes notice that you are no longer 
recognized as tax exempt or classified as a public charity in the Internal Revenue 
Bulletin. However, if a grantor or contributor takes any action, or fails to take any action, 
which causes you to lose your exempt status or causes you to be reclassified as a 
private foundation, that party cannot rely on this determination. Furthermore, a 
contributor or grantor who knows that the Internal Revenue Service has notified you of 
any change in your exempt status or foundation status cannot rely on this determination. 
Please see enclosed Publication 4221-PC, Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) Public 
Charities, for helpful information about your responsibilities as an exempt organization. 
Because this letter could help resolve any questions about your exempt status and/or 
foundation status, you should keep it with your permanent records.

Mr. Adrian Iglesias

Frisco, Texas 75034 
RE: REQUEST FOR EXPERIENCE CERTIFICATE UNDER 2017 UNIFORM MULTIFAMILY RULES 
Dear Mr. Iglesias: 
We have reviewed your request for art experience certificate, which is provided to individuals 
that meet the requirements of § 10.204(6) of the Uniform Multifamily ·Rules. In order to meet the 
experience requirements an individual must establish that they have experience in the development and 
placement in service of at least 150 residential units. We find that the documentation you have provided 
is sufficient to establish this required experience. Additionally, you have certified to compliance with the 
requirements of§ 10.204(6)(B), including the following requirements: 
(ii) Experience may not be established for a Person who at any time within the preceding 
three years has been involved with affordable housing in another state, in which the 
Person or Affiliate has been the subject of issued IRS Form 8823 citing non-compliance 
that has not been or is not being corrected with reasonable due diligence .... 
(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person may be used to establish such required 
experience if that Person or an Affiliate of that Person would not be eligible to be an 
Applicant themselves. 
Should you choose to participate as a member of the Development Team or an individual 
providing experience for any Application submitted for funding, a Previous Participation Review (10 
TAC § 1.5) may be conducted prior to any award of funds. Additionally, should it be determined at any 
point in time that the information provided in your request for experience is fraudulent, knowingly 
falsified, intentionally or negligibly materially misrepresented, or omits relevant information, this 
certificate of experience is null and void and you may be subject to other sanctions under the Texas 
Department of Housing and Community Affairs' rules and requirements.

Subject: 23461 Deficiency Notice - TIME SENSITIVE - Reply immediately to acknowledge receipt.
Date: Wednesday, July 12, 2023 12:45:00 PM
Importance: High
In the course of the Department’s Eligibility and Threshold review of the above referenced
application, an Administrative Deficiency as defined in §11.1(d)(2) and described in §11.201(6)(C)
of the 2023 QAP has been identified. By this notice, the Department is requesting documentation
to correct the following deficiency or deficiencies. Any issue initially identified as an
Administrative Deficiency may ultimately be determined to be beyond the scope of an
Administrative Deficiency process.  Applications with Material Deficiencies may be subject to
termination.
1.       Relate the Common Area reported in Tab 23 and Tab 23d to the Gross Per Floor Breakdown
on the sheet of tables that follows the architectural cover page.
2.       Confirm that Issuer Ongoing Compliance Fees include Issuer’s Ongoing Administrative Fees in
the Operating Expenses exhibit. Explain why there are Ongoing Administration Fees (i.e., are
the bonds to be retired at conversion).
3.       Hill Tide Development, LLC / Developer has a PPF and but was not found in the charts or List
of Organizations and Principals (LOP). RJ LOI references this organization as guarantor (i.e.,
then there must be an organization chart for it and it must be the headline organization of an
“Org.” block).
4.       Explain absence of PPF for George L. Strobel III, 100% beneficiary and trustee of Osprey Trust.
Unless the person that issued this deficiency notice, named below, specifies otherwise, submit all
documentation at the same time, and in only one file, using the Department’s Serv-U HTTPs
System. The applicable staff member must be notified by email when the submission is made. If
you have questions regarding the Serv-U HTTPs submission process, contact Jason Burr at
jason.burr@tdhca.state.tx.us  or by phone at (512)475-3986.
 
The above list may not include all Administrative Deficiencies such as those that may be
identified upon a supervisory review of the application. Notice of additional Deficiencies
may appear under separate cover.
 
Deficiencies must be resolved to the satisfaction of the Department by 5:00 p.m. on the
fifth business day following the date of the deficiency notice. Applications with unresolved
Administrative Deficiencies after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth business day following the date of
the deficiency notice will be suspended from further processing. Applications with
unresolved deficiencies after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth business day following the date of the
suspension will be terminated. The Applicant will be provided with notice regarding staff
action to suspend or terminate the Application. If the Application is terminated, Applicants
should review §11.201(6)(C) of the QAP as it relates to next steps should the Applicant still
desire to move forward. If the Application is layered with Direct Loan, Applicants are
--- Page 271 ---
encouraged to refer to §11.201(6)(D) of the QAP for guidance on how applications with
outstanding deficiencies will be handled if the funding source becomes oversubscribed
during the period of time when it is suspended from processing.
 
**All deficiencies must be corrected or clarified by 5 pm on Wednesday, July 19, 2023.
Please respond to this email as confirmation of receipt**
Thanks,

Re: TDHCA  #23461 Estates at Ferguson  – Applicant  Response  to Deficiency  Notice Dated July 13, 2023 
 
Dear Mr. Sheppard:  
 Please accept this letter and the attached documenta
 tion  on behalf of TX Ferguson  2022, Ltd. as a formal 
response  to your Deficiency  Notice dated July 13, 2023.  
 1. Common  Area Square Footage – See attached  breakdown  of common area, which was 
provided as page 104 of the application  PDF document.  Each square  footage figure can also 
be found on the plan tabul 
ations, which is attached  here and was provided as page 81 of the 
application  PDF. 
2. Annual Operating  Expense Exhibit, Ongoing  Bond Fees – The bond issuer charges an ongoing, 
annual administrative  fee equal to 0.1% of the bond  amount. There is no separate  ongoing 
compliance  fe
e in addition to this administrative  fee. The “Issuer Ongoing Compliance  Fees” 
line item in the Annual Operating  Expenses  exhibit seemed the most appropriate  place to list 
this administrative  fee, since in practice ongoing  administration  would  include activities such 
as compliance.  The bonds will not be retired at conversion,  which is why this fe e is included 
in the long term pro forma. 
3. Guarantor  – The Raymond  James equity letter has been revised to show Hill Tide Ventures, 
LLC rather  than Hill Tide Development,  LLC as guarantor.  Please disregard  the previous 
participation  exhibit for Hill Tide Development,  LLC. See attached revi sed  owner 
organizational  chart with the correct guarantors  listed. The structure  for Hill Tide Ventures,  
LLC is provided within the owner  organizational  chart. The previous participation  form for Hill 
Tide Ventures,  LLC was submitted  in the application.   
4. Previous Participation  for George L. Strobel III – Neither  George L. Strobel III, nor the en tity 
for which he is a trustee exercise control over the development.  Therefore,  a Previous 
Participation  Form is not required.  Per the instructions  on the Previous Participation  Form, 
“Form must be completed  separately  for each entity (i.e. person, organization,  etc.) that has 
or will have a controlling  interest or over sight  in the contract, award, agreement,  or ownership  
transfer being  considered.”  This is also consistent  with the Application  Submission  Procedures  
Manual, which states, “A separate  form must be completed  for each entity shown on the 
Owner and Developer  organizational  charts, and also for only those natural Persons shown on 
the Owner an d Developer  organizational  charts that  exercise Control .”

“S tabilized Operations ” means the date upon which all of the following 
events have occurred:  (i)  final completion of the Project and f inal closing of all 
permanent financing, and (ii)  Rent must be not less than $ 179,245 in each month 
of Stabilized Operatio n based on rental rates that, assuming one hundred percent 
(100%) occupancy, would achieve a monthly rental income of $192,737, and (iii ) 
for e ach of three (3) consecutive months (the last of which must end after or 
concur rently with Final Closing), the lesser of:  (a) actual Net Operating Income, 
or (b) Net Operating Income determined as if “Rent” equal ed 93% of the rent that 
would be due and payable if the Project attained 100% occupancy based on rental 
rates then being c harged for the Project (each as ap proved by RJAHI) is at least 
equal to 115 % of the Partnership’s Must -pay Debt Service. Achievement o f 
Stabilized Operations shall be sub ject to  the r eview and approval of RJAHI . 
 
4.
 Timing Adjusters:   
The capital contribution of the RJAHI  Fund shall be reduc ed by 50% of

admitted after Credits have begun to run.  
 
In the event that the actual C red its with respec t to the first C redit Year or 
second Credit Year  are more than the Credits projected for such years, then the 
capita l contribution of the RJAHI  Fund to the Par tnership shall be increased by 
an amount (the “Upward Timing Adjustment ”) equal  to 50% of such excess; 
provided, that any such increase is subject to the overall limitation that RJAHI  
Fund Total Capital cannot exc eed 105% of est imated RJAHI  Total Capital 
without RJAHI  Fund consent.  The Upward Timing Adjustment shall be made 
and appl ied to increase the Stabilization Capital Contribution.  It is understood 
and agreed that the Upward Timing Adjustment is intended to address any acceleratio n in the de livery of  the first or second  year of the Credit Period from 
the projected Credit amount s during such year where the total  projected Credits 
for the entire Credit Period is not affected and that the Upward Timing Adjustment may be decreased if the RJAHI  Fund determ ines in the exercise of its 
sole and absolute discretion that a smaller Upward Ti ming Adjustment must be 
paid in order to maintain the expected return on investment of its investors.

items that excee d rental and other inc ome through the date the 
RJAHI  Fund ma kes its final capital contribution.  
 
Any excess costs will not be considered loans or capital contri butions.  
However, the General Partners will also advance funds as n eeded during 
construction if  proceeds of financing a nd/or capital contributions are not 
yet available to pay such costs.  Such advances will be repaid, without 
interest, once such sources of funds become available.  
 The General Partners will also guarantee t hat the permanent financing 
will close and that the debt service on the permanent financing will not 
exceed an amount that would allow the Partnership to achieve Stabilized Operations wi thin a reasonable time.  Any reduction in principal amount 
of, or in terest rate on, the permanen t financing necessary to achieve 
Stabilized Operations will be considered an excess cost to be funded 
under the Completion Guaranty. 
 
In the event that certain events occur, the RJAHI  Fund shall have the 
right to require the Gen eral Partners to repurchase the RJAHI  Fund's 
interest for a price that returns 110% of i ts investment to date plus 
interest and any tax liability attributable to such payment.  Examples of  
such events include failure to complete construction, achieve break even 
operations or achieve S tabilized Operations by agreed -upon dates, failure 
to replace withdrawn commitments for, or close, permanent financing, 
loss of rental assistance, failure to qualify for at least seventy (70%) of 
the expected Credits, etc.  
 
b. Tax Credit Guaranty  – Guaranty t hat expected Credits w ill be available 
to the RJAHI  Fund and Credits taken will not be recaptured.  If the actual 
annual Credits available to the RJAHI  Fund in any year are lower than 
the Credits expected, the General Partners sha ll reimburse the RJAHI  
Fund for the shortfall on  a dollar for dollar basis.  If it is determined that 
the shortfall in Credits will apply to future years as well, General Partners will r efund an amount equal to the present value of those future 
credits.  If the RJAHI  Fund is subjec t to recapture (includ ing 
disallowance of credits) of previously claimed credits, the General 
Partners shall reimburse the RJAHI  Fund for its recapture amount.  To 
the extent that payments in respect of the Tax Credit Guaranty a re 
taxable, the payments sha ll be grossed -up to re imburse the RJAHI  Fund 
for the tax lia bility.  
 
 This guaranty shall apply to a period that ends at the end of the LIHTC 
compliance period. 
 
The General Partners will not be obligated if the reduction in the  amount 
of Credits or recapt ure is a result of a c hange in the tax law or the 
dispositio n by the RJAHI  Fund of its interest.
