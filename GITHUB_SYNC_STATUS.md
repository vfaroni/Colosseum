### 🚫 Excluded from GitHub (Too Large)
- **modules/** - Contains 5.2M+ lines and 9GB+ of data files
- **data_sets/** - Large geospatial and environmental datasets

## 🔧 Next Steps for Full Integration

### Option A: Local Development
Your GitHub repository is fully functional for development work. The core platform and all agents are available.

### Option B: Large File Management
For the complete modules directory:
1. **Git LFS** - Use Git Large File Storage for big data files
2. **Selective Upload** - Upload specific modules as needed
3. **Documentation Only** - Keep data references local

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Keep production data in Dropbox (current setup)
- Use GitHub for code development and collaboration
- Reference data paths in documentation

## 🎉 Success Summary
- **Your Dropbox remains untouched** ✅
- **Core functionality on GitHub** ✅  
- **Complete agent system available** ✅
- **Ready for development work** ✅
