# California Transportation Data Acquisition Infrastructure

## Purpose
Internal infrastructure for acquiring and maintaining California transportation datasets to support LIHTC site analysis and affordable housing development intelligence.

## Architecture
- **Code Location**: `/Colosseum/infrastructure/data_acquisition/california_transportation/`
- **Data Storage**: `/Data_Sets/california/CA_Transportation/`
- **Metadata Standards**: Comprehensive tracking per CLAUDE.md requirements

## Core Components
- `california_transport_orchestrator.py` - Main acquisition coordinator
- `metadata_generator.py` - Automated metadata creation
- `dataset_validator.py` - Quality assurance and validation
- `update_tracker.py` - Future update monitoring system

## Dataset Metadata Requirements
Every dataset MUST include:
1. Source attribution and URL
2. Acquisition timestamp
3. Dataset compilation/update date
4. Update frequency and monitoring strategy
5. File details and format information
6. Quality assessment and validation results

## Mission Objectives
- Acquire 6 priority transportation datasets from data.ca.gov
- Establish sustainable metadata tracking system
- Create framework for future California data acquisition
- Enhance LIHTC transportation analysis capabilities

## Success Criteria
- All datasets with complete metadata documentation
- Validated coordinate systems and data quality
- Integration with existing California datasets
- Documented update and maintenance procedures
