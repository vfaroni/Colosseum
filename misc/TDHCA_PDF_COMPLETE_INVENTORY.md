## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT FINDINGS

### What We Have:
‚úÖ **4% Applications**: At least 2-4 confirmed (24400, 24403, possibly 24600, 24601)
‚úÖ **9% Applications**: 38+ files from 2023 and 2025
‚úÖ **Complete Applications**: Full PDFs with all exhibits (30MB-170MB)
‚úÖ **Market Reports**: 3 CoStar reports

### What Might Be Missing:
‚ùì **More 2024 4% Applications**: You mentioned a "whole year's worth" of 4% deals
- The empty directories suggest files were expected but not present
- Only found 4 files from 2024 (2-4 being 4%)
- May be on M1 machine as you suspected

### File Size Pattern Analysis:
- **9% Competitive**: Typically 40MB-170MB (full applications with exhibits)
- **4% Bond**: Similar sizes when complete (31MB-50MB found)
- Large variation likely due to number of exhibits included

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Immediate Actions:
- ‚úÖ We have at least 42 complete TDHCA applications
- ‚úÖ Confirmed location of 4% applications in `/raw_data/4pct_applications/`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check M1 machine for additional 2024 4% applications

### 2. Organization Plan:
```bash
# Proposed new structure in data_sets/
/data_sets/texas/TDHCA_Applications/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2023/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9pct/ (22 files, ~1.5GB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 4pct/ (2-4 files, ~140MB)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9pct/ (if any found)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9pct/ (16 files, ~1GB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Market_Reports/ (3 files)
```

### 3. Search Other Locations:
- Check M1 machine for missing 2024 4% applications
- Look for any external drives or other Dropbox folders
- Search for patterns like "24-6*" for more 4% apps

## üìã NEXT STEPS

1. **Confirm if more files exist on M1**
2. **Create migration script for found files**
3. **Organize by year and type (4% vs 9%)**
4. **Create extraction pipeline for RAG integration**

Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to migrate the files we've found?
2. Generate a more detailed analysis of the file contents?
3. Set up the directory structure for the migration?

**Note**: The files we have are substantial (2.5GB of TDHCA applications) and represent a valuable dataset for analysis, even if some 2024 4% applications might be on another machine.
