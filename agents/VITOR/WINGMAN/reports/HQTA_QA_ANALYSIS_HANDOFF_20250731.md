## üö® **URGENT DISCOVERY: 15 SITES QUALIFY FOR 7 POINTS INSTEAD OF 4**

### **Executive Summary**
Bill's WINGMAN analyzed your CTCAC transit compliance report and discovered **15 sites that should receive 7 points (HQTA) instead of 4 points**. Your transit stop analysis was accurate, but the **HQTA polygon boundaries** were not checked.

### **Key Findings**
- **‚úÖ Your Analysis Accuracy**: Transit stop counting and distance measurements were correct
- **‚ùå Missing Component**: HQTA (High Quality Transit Area) polygon intersection analysis
- **üéØ Result**: 15 sites within official HQTA boundaries qualify for higher scoring
- **üí∞ Impact**: 45+ additional CTCAC points across portfolio

accurate, but HQTA polygon boundaries weren't checked.

Key Findings:
- 15 HIGH priority sites within official HQTA boundaries
- Potential 45+ additional CTCAC points across portfolio
- Sites include Glendale (35 stops), Santa Monica (25 stops), BART locations

Deliverables Ready:
- Enhanced Excel with 8 blue QA columns added to your data
- Complete analysis report with coordinates and next steps
- Reusable QA script for future analyses

Files located in: /Colosseum/agents/VITOR/coordination/

This is a significant scoring opportunity - let's coordinate integration 
of HQTA checks into your standard workflow.

Best,
