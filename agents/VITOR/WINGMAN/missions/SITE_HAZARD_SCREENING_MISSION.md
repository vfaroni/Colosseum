def analyze_fire_hazard(latitude, longitude):
    """
    Comprehensive fire hazard analysis for California sites
    Returns: {
        "risk_level": "Low" | "Moderate" | "High" | "Very High",
        "fire_zone": "Urban" | "Wildland" | "Interface",
        "hazard_severity": 1-4 scale,
        "disqualifying": True | False,  # True if High/Very High
        "data_source": "CAL FIRE FHSZ 2025"
    }
    """
```

### **Assignment 3: Site Screening & Filtering**
**Priority**: HIGH

#### **Filtering Criteria**
```python
# Sites to ELIMINATE from development consideration
elimination_criteria = {
    "flood_risk": ["High", "Extreme", "SFHA Yes"],
    "fire_hazard": ["High", "Very High"],
    "combined_risk": "Any high-risk factor disqualifies site"
}

# Expected elimination rate: 15-25% of 630 sites
```

#### **Output Requirements**
```
Create filtered Excel files:
├── CostarExport_HighResource_HAZARD_FILTERED_20250130.xlsx
│   └── Sites passing ALL safety criteria
├── CostarExport_ELIMINATED_SITES_20250130.xlsx
│   └── Sites eliminated with elimination reasons
└── HAZARD_ANALYSIS_REPORT_20250130.md
    └── Comprehensive analysis summary
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **Data Integration Requirements**
```python
# Integration with existing BOTN engine
from src.analyzers.fire_hazard_analyzer import FireHazardAnalyzer
from src.analyzers.flood_analyzer import FloodAnalyzer  # May need creation

# Performance optimization for 630 sites
class BatchHazardAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fire_analyzer = FireHazardAnalyzer()
        self.flood_analyzer = FloodAnalyzer()
        
    def analyze_sites_batch(self, sites_df):
        """Process 630 sites efficiently with progress tracking"""
```

### **Quality Assurance Protocol**
```python
# Validation against known high-risk areas
validation_tests = [
    {"lat": 34.0522, "lng": -118.2437, "expected_fire": "High"},  # LA Hills
    {"lat": 33.7701, "lng": -117.1937, "expected_flood": "Low"},  # Riverside
    {"lat": 38.5816, "lng": -121.4944, "expected_both": "Low"}    # Sacramento
