# üèîÔ∏è TERRAIN ELEVATION ANALYSIS MISSION - STEEP SLOPE AVOIDANCE

**Mission ID**: VITOR-WINGMAN-TERRAIN-001  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Requestor**: Vitor Faroni  
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Target**: Terrain Analysis Integration for LIHTC Site Screening

---

## üéØ MISSION OBJECTIVE

Implement terrain elevation analysis system to identify and avoid recommending land sites located on steep sloped terrain that would be unsuitable for LIHTC development. The system should analyze terrain heights for different coordinates and flag sites with problematic slopes before they reach final recommendations.

---

## üìã REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

### Current Problem:
- LIHTC sites are being recommended without consideration of terrain suitability
- Steep sloped sites create construction challenges and increased costs
- No early warning system for problematic topography

### Target Solution:
- Automated terrain height lookup for all site coordinates
- Slope calculation between site boundaries and nearby terrain
- Risk categorization for construction feasibility
- Integration with existing site screening workflow

## üîß TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### 1. **Elevation Data Sources** üìä
**Primary**: USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) API
- Resolution: 1/3 arc-second (~10 meter) DEM data
- Coverage: Complete United States
- API Endpoint: `https://elevation.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/`

**Backup**: USGS Elevation Point Query Service
- Single point elevation queries
- Fallback for API limitations

### 2. **Slope Calculation Methods** üìê
```python
# Calculate slope percentage between two points
slope_percent = ((elevation_high - elevation_low) / horizontal_distance) * 100

# Risk categories for LIHTC development:
# 0-2%: Ideal (minimal grading)
# 2-5%: Good (standard grading)  
# 5-10%: Moderate (increased costs)
# 10-15%: High Risk (significant grading/retaining walls)
# >15%: Unsuitable (avoid recommendation)
```

### 3. **Analysis Points** üéØ
For each site, analyze:
- **Site Center**: Primary elevation
- **Site Corners**: Maximum elevation variance
- **100m Buffer**: Surrounding terrain context
- **Access Points**: Potential driveway/utility connections

---

## üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Data Integration
1. **API Setup**: Configure USGS 3DEP elevation services
2. **Coordinate Processing**: Extract lat/lon from site data
3. **Batch Queries**: Efficient multi-point elevation requests
4. **Error Handling**: Fallback for API limitations

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine
1. **Slope Calculator**: Multi-point terrain analysis
2. **Risk Assessment**: Categorization based on development feasibility
3. **Site Flagging**: Integration with existing filtering system
4. **Cost Impact**: Preliminary grading cost estimates

### Phase 3: Integration
1. **BOTN Engine**: Add terrain analysis to site screening
2. **Reporting**: Include slope analysis in site reports
3. **Dashboard**: Visual terrain risk indicators
4. **Workflow**: Automatic filtering of unsuitable sites

## üìä EXPECTED OUTPUTS

### Site-Level Analysis:
```json
{
  "site_id": "SITE_001",
  "terrain_analysis": {
    "center_elevation_ft": 1250,
    "elevation_range_ft": 35,
    "max_slope_percent": 8.5,
    "risk_category": "MODERATE",
    "construction_impact": "Increased grading costs $15,000-25,000",
    "recommendation": "PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION",
    "analysis_points": [
      {"lat": 34.123, "lon": -118.456, "elevation_ft": 1235},
      {"lat": 34.124, "lon": -118.457, "elevation_ft": 1270}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Risk Categories:
- **IDEAL** (0-2% slope): Minimal site preparation
- **GOOD** (2-5% slope): Standard grading requirements
- **MODERATE** (5-10% slope): Increased construction costs
- **HIGH_RISK** (10-15% slope): Major grading/retaining walls
- **UNSUITABLE** (>15% slope): Do not recommend
