## üìã SEQUENTIAL FILTERING PROTOCOL

### **Phase 0: Dataset Preparation**
- ‚úÖ **Backup Original**: Always create copies before any deletions
- ‚úÖ **Load Complete Dataset**: Use `CostarExport_AllLand_Combined_20250727_184937.xlsx` (2,676 sites)
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Confirm 728 Northern California sites present
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Log all elimination steps with counts

### **Phase 1: Size Filtering (Basic Feasibility)**
**Criterion**: Eliminate sites with less than 1 acre
- **Action**: DELETE sites where Acreage < 1.0 OR Square Feet < 43,560
- **Exception**: If acreage/SF not listed, KEEP the site
- **Rationale**: LIHTC developments require minimum viable size
- **Expected Impact**: ~20-30% elimination

### **Phase 2: Federal Qualification Filtering (QCT/DDA)** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ERROR IDENTIFIED**
**Criterion**: Eliminate sites NOT in DDA or QCT
- **Action**: DELETE sites where QCT_qualified = False AND DDA_qualified = False
- **Data Source**: HUD QCT/DDA 2025 data (18,685 records validated) - **INTEGRATION REQUIRED**
- **Rationale**: Federal qualification provides 30% basis boost (mandatory for viability)
- **Expected Impact**: ~60-70% of remaining sites eliminated
- **üö® CURRENT STATUS**: Used simulated data - **INVALID RESULTS**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR**: Coordinates 33.23218, -117.2267 incorrectly passed (not QCT/DDA qualified)
- **‚úÖ CORRECTION**: Must integrate real HUD QCT/DDA analyzer from existing LIHTC system

### **Phase 3: Resource Area Filtering (California CTCAC)**
**Criterion**: Eliminate sites NOT in High or Highest Resource Areas
- **Action**: DELETE sites where Resource_Category ‚â† 'High Resource' AND ‚â† 'Highest Resource'
- **Data Source**: CA CTCAC 2025 Opportunity Map data
- **Rationale**: High/Highest Resource Areas provide competitive scoring advantage
- **Expected Impact**: ~40-50% of remaining sites eliminated

### **Phase 4: Flood Risk Filtering (Safety/Insurance)**
**Criterion**: Eliminate sites in high flood risk areas
- **Action**: DELETE sites where Flood_Risk_Area = 'High Risk Areas'
- **Data Source**: Existing dataset flood data + FEMA validation
- **Rationale**: High flood risk creates insurance/development complications
- **Expected Impact**: ~5-10% of remaining sites eliminated

### **Phase 5: SFHA Filtering (Flood Insurance)**
**Criterion**: Eliminate sites in Special Flood Hazard Areas
- **Action**: DELETE sites where In_SFHA = 'Yes'
- **Data Source**: FEMA SFHA designations in existing dataset
- **Rationale**: SFHA sites require flood insurance (cost/feasibility impact)
- **Expected Impact**: ~10-15% of remaining sites eliminated

### **Phase 6: Land Use Filtering (Development Compatibility)**  
**Criterion**: Eliminate sites with prohibited uses
- **Action**: DELETE sites with current use = Agriculture, Industrial, Auto, Gas Station, Dry Cleaning
- **Data Source**: Research and implement land use data sources
- **Rationale**: Prohibited uses incompatible with residential LIHTC development
- **Expected Impact**: ~10-20% of remaining sites eliminated
- **Note**: SAVE AS LAST CRITERIA per user instruction

## üö® **CRITICAL ERROR REPORT - 2025-07-31 10:35**

### **Error Identification**
**User Validation**: Coordinates 33.23218, -117.2267 found in final portfolio  
**Issue**: Site is NOT QCT or DDA qualified (user verified)  
**Impact**: Phase 2 filtering FAILED - used simulated data instead of real HUD analysis  

### **Current Portfolio Status**
‚ùå **INVALID**: Current portfolio of 207 sites contains non-qualified sites  
‚ùå **Business Risk**: Sites lack 30% federal basis boost eligibility  
‚ùå **Production Risk**: Portfolio not suitable for LIHTC development  

### **Immediate Action Required**
1. **Integrate HUD QCT/DDA Analyzer**: Use existing 18,685-record system from LIHTC module
2. **Eliminate Simulation Mode**: Remove random 30% sampling fallback
3. **Re-run Complete Filtering**: All phases 1-6 with corrected Phase 2
4. **Validate Correction**: Confirm test coordinates eliminated

### **Expected Correction Impact**
- **Portfolio Size**: Likely reduction from 207 to <150 sites (real QCT/DDA qualification rates)
- **Quality**: 100% sites will have genuine federal qualification
- **Business Value**: Restored confidence in portfolio viability

**Mission Classification**: Strategic Implementation - **ERROR CORRECTION MODE**  
**Expected Duration**: 1-2 days (correction priority)  
**Success Probability**: High (HUD data source available, error root cause identified)  
**Business Value**: Critical (restore portfolio integrity)
