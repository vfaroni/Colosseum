## 📊 **CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS**

### **Portfolio Status**
- **Current Safe Sites**: 334 properties (post-hazard analysis)
- **Next Filter**: Prior site use analysis (Phase 6 of BOTN system)
- **Expected Elimination**: 10-20% of sites (33-67 properties)
- **Final Expected**: 267-301 development-ready sites

### **Risk Categories Identified**
1. **Agricultural Contamination**: Pesticide/herbicide soil contamination
2. **Industrial Pollution**: Chemical contamination, soil pollution, regulatory liability
3. **Petroleum Contamination**: Gas stations, auto facilities, underground storage tanks
4. **Dry Cleaning Operations**: PCE/TCE chemical contamination (expensive remediation)

   - **Validation**: Google Places API integration (framework ready)
   - **Regulatory**: Zoning database integration (research required)

### **Phase 2: Environmental Database Integration**
1. **Texas Environmental System**
   - **Location**: `/modules/data_intelligence/environmental_screening/`
   - **Records**: 797,403 environmental contamination sites
   - **Petroleum Sites**: 29,646 sites with contamination history
   - **Active Monitoring**: 1,106 sites requiring ongoing oversight

2. **California Environmental Extension**
   - Research CA environmental databases (CalEPA, SWRCB)
   - Integrate federal Superfund (NPL) sites
   - Add CERCLIS and RCRIS contamination databases

### **Phase 3: Production Testing Framework**
1. **Test Site Categories**
   ```
   High-Risk Test Cases:
   ├── Agricultural: Farms, ranches, crop production facilities
   ├── Industrial: Manufacturing, warehouses, chemical facilities
   ├── Automotive: Gas stations, auto dealerships, repair shops
   ├── Dry Cleaning: Laundromats, cleaning facilities
   └── Environmental: Known contaminated sites from database
   ```

2. **Validation Scenarios**
   - Test against known contaminated properties
   - Validate false positive reduction
   - Ensure legitimate development sites pass through
   - Performance testing with 334-site portfolio
