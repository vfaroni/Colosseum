mv completed_mission.md agents/VITOR/TOWER/missions/archive/

# Archive individual oversight reports (keep only session handoff active)
mv oversight_report.md agents/VITOR/TOWER/reports/archive/

# Maintain clean active directories:
- missions/: Current missions + template only
- reports/: Current session handoff + template only
```

### **Archive Directory Organization**
```
agents/VITOR/TOWER/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ missions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [CURRENT_MISSION].md        # Active missions only
