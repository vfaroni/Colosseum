## üìã ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS NOW ACTIVE

### **Mandatory Agent Requirements**
```bash
# Before ANY commit, agents must ensure:

# 1. MANDATORY testing validation
python3 scripts/enforce_testing_protocols.py

# 2. Mission documentation compliance  
python3 scripts/check_mission_compliance.py

# 3. Overall compliance validation
./scripts/tower_compliance_check.sh

# All commits will be automatically validated - non-compliance BLOCKS commits
```

### **Agent Directory Structure Requirements**
```
MANDATORY STRUCTURE (NO EXCEPTIONS):
agents/[USER]/[AGENT_TYPE]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ missions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [MISSION_NAME]_MISSION.md     # BEFORE work starts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MISSION_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md     # Always active
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [MISSION_NAME]_COMPLETE.md    # AFTER work completes
