## 🎯 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern-Based Classification Engine
```python
# Deal Patterns (NEVER move to news)
deal_patterns = [
    'portfolio sale', 'loan sale', 'asset sale', 'property sale',
    'investment opportunity', 'deal room', 'offering', 'acquisition',
    'development', 'units', 'sf', 'square feet', 'acres',
    'million', 'billion', '$', 'upb', 'cap rate', 'noi',
    'lihtc', 'tax credit', 'housing development'
]

# News Patterns (Safe to move)
news_patterns = {
    'newsletters': ['newsletter', 'enews', 'bulletin', 'roundup'],
    'marketing': ['unsubscribe', 'special offer', 'promotion'],
    'automated': ['noreply', 'no-reply', 'automated', 'system']
}
```

### Classification Logic
1. **Safety Check**: Reply emails, meetings, deadlines → KEEP
2. **Deal Check**: Any deal patterns detected → KEEP  
3. **News Scoring**: Newsletter + automated patterns → MOVE (if score >= 2)
4. **Default**: Uncertain content → KEEP (conservative approach)
