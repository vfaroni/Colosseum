**Subject**: URGENT: 15 CTCAC Sites Qualify for 7 Points Instead of 4 - HQTA QA Analysis Complete

---

Hi Vitor,

**TL;DR**: Found 15 sites in your CTCAC analysis that should get **7 points instead of 4** - they're within official HQTA boundaries but this wasn't checked.

## üéØ Key Discovery
Your transit stop analysis was **accurate** (great work on the 35 stops, 25 stops, etc.), but we missed the **HQTA polygon boundaries** check. I ran your 263 sites against California's official High Quality Transit Areas dataset and found **15 HIGH priority sites** that qualify for the 7-point HQTA scoring.

## üìä Impact
- **15 sites** can be upgraded from 4 ‚Üí 7 points  
- **45+ additional CTCAC points** across the portfolio
- Sites include prime locations: Glendale, Santa Monica, BART areas, VTA corridors

## üìã Files Ready for You
Located in `/Colosseum/agents/VITOR/coordination/`:

1. **Enhanced Excel**: Your original 263 sites + 8 blue QA columns with HQTA analysis
2. **Summary Report**: Detailed findings with coordinates and next steps  
3. **QA Script**: Reusable Python tool for future HQTA validation
4. **Handoff Doc**: Complete technical methodology and collaboration notes

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. **Spot Check**: Verify 3-5 of the high-priority sites manually
2. **Peak Service**: Confirm 30-minute peak hour service for HQTA compliance
3. **Update Applications**: Begin CTCAC scoring corrections for the 15 sites
4. **Integration**: Add HQTA polygon check to your standard workflow

## ü§ù Collaboration Notes
- Your transit expertise + my geospatial analysis = complete CTCAC solution
- This is a **QA enhancement**, not a criticism - your core analysis was solid
- Let's integrate HQTA checks into your standard process going forward

**This is a significant scoring opportunity** with immediate business impact. The files are ready for your review.

Best,
Bill
