## ⚡ **PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES**

### **Safe Parallel Combinations**
```
Recommended Parallel Execution:
├── WINGMAN: Continue CABOTN hazard analysis
├── SECRETARY: Launch email management system (NEW)
├── TOWER: Continue strategic oversight
└── STRIKE LEADER: Coordinate and prepare next missions
```

### **Resource Conflict Analysis**
```
✅ NO CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED:

## 🔄 **DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION TRIGGERS**

### **Auto-Unblock Conditions**
```python
# Dependency resolution logic
dependency_triggers = {
    "transit_analysis_unblock": {
        "condition": "File exists: Sites/CostarExport_HighResource_HAZARD_FILTERED_*.xlsx",
        "trigger": "Launch VITOR-WINGMAN-TRANSIT-002",
        "notification": "Strike Leader coordination required",
        "estimated_time": "Within 24 hours of hazard completion"
    },
    
    "portfolio_integration": {
        "condition": "Both hazard + transit analysis complete",
        "trigger": "Final portfolio creation mission",
        "notification": "Revenue-ready site portfolio available",
        "business_impact": "$950M-1.9B development opportunity"
    }
}
```

### **Manual Coordination Points**
```
Strike Leader Decision Points:
├── Wingman Completion: Choose transit analysis OR new project
├── Secretary Success: Integrate email results with deal pipeline
├── Tower Insights: Act on strategic recommendations
└── Resource Reallocation: Shift agents based on priority changes
```

## 📋 **HANDOFF PROTOCOLS**

### **Wingman → Wingman (Hazard → Transit)**
```
Handoff Requirements:
├── Input File: CostarExport_HighResource_HAZARD_FILTERED_*.xlsx
├── Site Count: ~475 development-ready sites (expected)
├── Data Quality: Complete hazard analysis for all sites
├── Documentation: Hazard elimination reasoning and statistics
├── Mission Status: VITOR-WINGMAN-HAZARD-001 marked COMPLETED
└── Next Trigger: VITOR-WINGMAN-TRANSIT-002 launch
```

### **Cross-Project Integration Points**
```
Integration Opportunities:
├── Email Secretary + CABOTN Results:
│   └── Connect identified deals to site analysis capability
├── Strategic Analysis + All Projects:
│   └── Business intelligence feedback loop
├── Deal Pipeline + Portfolio Results:
│   └── Convert analyzed sites to active opportunities
└── Revenue Model + All Systems:
    └── Monetize automated capabilities as services
```
