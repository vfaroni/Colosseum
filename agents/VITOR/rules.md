## üîÑ STEP-BY-STEP DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (TDD MANDATORY)

### CRITICAL: Every coding task MUST follow this sequence

### Step 1: Plan and Branch (MANDATORY)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Create new Git branch for every feature/bugfix
- **Naming**: `feature/descriptive-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`
- **Command**: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Never commit directly to main

### Step 2: Define Contracts and Tests First (TDD MANDATORY)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Create/update `test_plan.md` in relevant module
- **Contents Required**:
  - Feature Description
  - Contracts/Requirements (inputs, outputs, edge cases)
  - Test Cases (positive, negative, edge cases)
- **Implementation**: Write actual test code using pytest
- **Validation**: Tests must fail initially (no code exists yet)

### Step 3: Implement Code (MANDATORY STANDARDS)
- **Approach**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
- **Standards**:
  - Meaningful variable/function names
  - Docstrings for all functions
  - Type hints (e.g., `def func(x: int) -> str:`)
  - Error handling with try/except
  - Single responsibility principle
- **Testing**: Re-run tests after each change

### Step 4: Refactor and E2E Tests (MANDATORY)
- **Code Quality**: Improve readability without changing behavior
- **E2E Testing**: Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows
- **Tools**: Use pytest with fixtures
- **Requirement**: All tests must pass before proceeding

### Step 5: Test and Review (MANDATORY - NO COMMITS WITHOUT APPROVAL)
- **Local Testing**: Run all tests (`pytest` or `python -m unittest`)
- **Results Reporting**: Include test outputs in completion reports
- **GitHub Process**: 
  - Push branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`
  - Create Pull Request with test results and test_plan.md link
  - Assign business partner for review
- **NO DIRECT COMMITS**: Always use PR process

### Step 6: Merge and Cleanup (POST-APPROVAL ONLY)
- **Merge**: Only after PR approval and passing tests
- **Cleanup**: Delete branch after merge
- **Sync**: Update Dropbox files (GitHub is source of truth)

---

## üìã QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOLS

### Rule 7: Pre-Integration Data Validation (MANDATORY)
**ALL agent deliverables must be validated before integration**

#### Validation Steps:
1. **Sample Testing**: Extract and review minimum 10 random samples
2. **Domain Coherence Check**: Verify content matches expected terminology  
3. **Format Validation**: Ensure data structure matches specifications
4. **Completeness Audit**: Confirm all required fields populated correctly

#### Failure Thresholds (AUTO-STOP):
- **>20% nonsensical content**: STOP - Debug extraction patterns
- **<50% domain-relevant terms**: STOP - Redesign domain targeting  
- **>10% structural errors**: STOP - Fix data processing pipeline

### Rule 8: Cross-Agent Verification Matrix (MANDATORY)
- **WINGMAN ‚Üí TOWER**: TOWER validates all WINGMAN technical deliverables
- **TOWER ‚Üí STRIKE_LEADER**: STRIKE_LEADER validates all TOWER strategic recommendations
- **All agents ‚Üí External**: External validation before production integration

### Rule 9: Quality Gates Implementation
**Mandatory Checkpoints**:
1. **Agent Deliverable Creation**: Self-validation before handoff
2. **Cross-Agent Handoff**: Secondary agent validation  
3. **Lead Agent Integration**: Final validation before production use
4. **Production Deployment**: External validation and testing

**Quality Gate Failure Response**:
1. **STOP**: Immediately halt workflow progression
2. **DEBUG**: Identify root cause of quality failure
3. **FIX**: Implement corrections to address failure
4. **RE-VALIDATE**: Repeat quality checks before proceeding
