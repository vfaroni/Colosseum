# üöå TRANSIT SCORING FIX MISSION - CTCAC COMPLIANCE

**Mission ID**: STRIKE-TRANSIT-001  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Requestor**: Bill Rice  
**Target**: Vitor's BOTN Engine Transit Processor  
**Date**: 2025-08-06  

---

## üéØ MISSION OBJECTIVE

Fix critical issues in Vitor's BOTN engine transit scoring that prevent proper CTCAC point calculation for non-HQTA bus routes. The current implementation fails to correctly parse bus route frequency data, resulting in incorrect or zero transit points for sites that should qualify.

---

## üîç ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Incorrect Frequency Calculation** ‚ùå
**Location**: `ultimate_ctcac_transit_processor.py` lines 258-265
```python
# WRONG - Current code:
frequency_minutes = 30 / n_routes if n_routes > 0 else 999
```
**Problem**: This assumes 30 minutes divided by number of routes. A stop with 3 routes gets 10-minute frequency - mathematically nonsensical.

### 2. **Missing Peak Hour Schedule Analysis** ‚ùå
- No actual GTFS schedule parsing
- Only uses rough 20% estimate of daily arrivals
- No verification of 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM peak requirements

### 3. **Wrong Point Assignment** ‚ùå
- Only awards 4 base + 1 tiebreaker (max 5 points)
- CTCAC actually allows 3-7 points based on distance/frequency
- Missing 6-point tier for high-frequency service

### 4. **No Proper Frequency Validation** ‚ùå
- Missing check for `n_arrivals >= 30 AND n_hours_in_service >= 8`
- No validation of actual peak hour service

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Corrected Frequency Calculation**
```python
# STRIKE_LEADER FIX: Proper frequency calculation
if n_arrivals > 0 and n_hours_in_service >= 8:
    # Peak hours are ~4 hours (7-9 AM + 4-6 PM)
    peak_arrivals = n_arrivals * (4 / n_hours_in_service)
    frequency_minutes = 240 / peak_arrivals  # 4 hours = 240 minutes
```

### 2. **Proper CTCAC Scoring Implementation**
- 7 points: HQTA or high-frequency (‚â§30 min) within 1/3 mile + high density
- 6 points: HQTA or high-frequency (‚â§30 min) within 1/3 mile
- 5 points: HQTA or high-frequency within 1/2 mile
- 4 points: Basic transit within 1/3 mile
- 3 points: Basic transit within 1/2 mile

### 3. **Added High-Frequency Validation**
- Check for 30+ arrivals during service hours
- Verify 8+ hours of service minimum
- Calculate actual peak hour frequency

## üìÅ DELIVERABLES

1. **corrected_ultimate_ctcac_transit_processor.py**
   - Fully corrected transit processor
   - Deep annotations explaining every fix
   - Compatible with existing BOTN infrastructure

2. **TRANSIT_SCORING_FIX_AFTER_ACTION_REPORT.md**
   - Detailed test results
   - Before/after comparison
   - Integration instructions

---

## üîß INTEGRATION NOTES

1. The corrected processor maintains the same class structure and method signatures
2. All fixes are marked with `STRIKE_LEADER FIX:` comments
3. Original logic preserved where correct
4. New validation methods added for high-frequency determination

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES FOR WINGMAN

1. **Do NOT modify** the existing data loading methods
2. **Preserve** all HQTA polygon logic (it works correctly)
3. **Test** with sites that have bus stops but no HQTA designation
4. **Verify** points now range from 3-7, not just 0 or 4-5

---

**Mission Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Next Step**: Create corrected processor file with deep annotations
