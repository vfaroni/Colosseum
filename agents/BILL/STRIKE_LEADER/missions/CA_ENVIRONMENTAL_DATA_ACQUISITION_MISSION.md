## üèõÔ∏è MISSION COMMAND OVERVIEW

### Strategic Objective
Acquire and integrate comprehensive environmental datasets for California to match our exceptional 19-county parcel coverage (10M+ parcels, 75%+ population), enabling superior LIHTC site screening and competitive advantage in affordable housing development.

### Business Impact
- **Cost Savings**: $10,000+ per property vs commercial environmental services
- **Speed Advantage**: Instant screening vs 3-5 day commercial turnaround
- **Competitive Edge**: Only platform with parcel-boundary environmental analysis
- **Revenue Potential**: Foundation for premium CA environmental screening services
