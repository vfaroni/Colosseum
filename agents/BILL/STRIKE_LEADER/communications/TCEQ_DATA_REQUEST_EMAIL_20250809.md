Dear TCEQ Data Team,

I am writing to request access to several TCEQ environmental databases for use in affordable housing development due diligence. We are working on Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) projects throughout Texas and need comprehensive environmental screening data to ensure compliance with federal and state requirements.

## Current TCEQ Data We Have

We have successfully obtained and are utilizing the following TCEQ datasets from your open data portal:

1. **Environmental Complaints** (Texas_Commission_on_Environmental_Quality_-_Complaints_20250702.csv)
   - ~500,000 records

2. **Leaking Petroleum Storage Tank (LPST) Sites** (Texas_Commission_on_Environmental_Quality_-_Leaking_Petroleum_Storage_Tank__LPST__Sites_20250702.csv)
   - 29,646 records

3. **Notices of Enforcement (NOE)** (Texas_Commission_on_Environmental_Quality_-_Notices_of_Enforcement__NOE__20250702.csv)
   - ~25,000 records

4. **Notice of Registration - Waste (NOR)** (Texas_Commission_on_Environmental_Quality_-_NOR_Waste_20250702.csv)
   - ~150,000 records

5. **Dry Cleaner Facilities** (both historical and operating)
   - ~52,000 records

## Additional Datasets Requested

To complete our environmental due diligence capabilities for LIHTC development, we are seeking access to the following critical databases:

### Priority 1: Site Remediation Databases
1. **State Superfund Registry Sites**
   - All Texas state-managed Superfund sites
   - Including site addresses, contaminants, and remediation status

2. **Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) Sites**
   - Complete list of VCP properties
   - VCP ID numbers, addresses, and cleanup status

3. **Industrial and Hazardous Waste (IHW) Corrective Action Sites**
   - Facilities under corrective action orders
   - RCRA IDs and corrective action status

4. **Active Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Sites**
   - Currently active/open LUST cases (not yet closed)
   - Distinct from the LPST closed sites we already have

### Priority 2: Facility and Tank Registrations
5. **Registered Underground Storage Tanks (UST) and Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST)**
   - Currently registered tank facilities
   - Tank IDs, facility addresses, and registration status

6. **Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Landfills**
   - Active and closed landfill facilities
   - Permit numbers and facility boundaries if available

7. **Texas Brownfields Sites**
   - Properties enrolled in the Brownfields program
   - Site IDs and remediation status

8. **Spill Incident Database**
   - Historical spill incidents with location data
   - Material types and cleanup status

## Intended Use

This data will be used exclusively for:
- Environmental due diligence for affordable housing development
- Phase I Environmental Site Assessment support
- Compliance with ASTM E1527-21 standards
- Risk assessment for LIHTC project siting

We are a consulting firm specializing in affordable housing development and need this data to ensure proposed LIHTC sites meet all environmental safety requirements.

## Preferred Format

We can work with any standard data format:
- CSV or Excel preferred
- GIS shapefiles or geodatabase also acceptable
- API access if available

If bulk downloads are not readily available, we would be happy to submit a formal Public Information Act request or discuss alternative data access methods.
