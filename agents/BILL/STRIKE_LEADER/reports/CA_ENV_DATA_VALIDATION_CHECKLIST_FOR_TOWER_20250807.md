### üîç QUALITY SCORING FRAMEWORK

#### Scoring Methodology
```
Quality Score = (
    (Coverage √ó 0.25) +
    (Completeness √ó 0.25) +
    (Accuracy √ó 0.30) +
    (Freshness √ó 0.20)
) √ó 100
```

#### Score Interpretation
- **95-100**: Production Ready ‚úÖ
- **90-94**: Minor fixes needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **85-89**: Significant gaps üî∂
- **<85**: Not acceptable ‚ùå
